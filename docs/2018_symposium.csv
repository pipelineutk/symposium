The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of housing dams and calves together, starting on d 5 postpartum, versus dams and calves separately, on milk production, behavior, and calf growth. Cow-calf pairs (N = 20) were separated within 6 h of calving and randomly assigned to either: group calf housing on pasture nightly (20:00 to 6:00) and dams and calves housed together on pasture nightly, from d 5 to 19. Calves were fed 4 L/d of 26% crude protein, 20% fat BOV SC ClariFly Medicated Dairy Herd & Beef Calf Milk Replacer (Ag Central Co Op, Madisonville, TN) until d 4 and 6 L/d until d 19. Dams were housed on sand bedded freestalls (6:00 to 19:30) and separated daily, with half remaining indoors and half housed with their calves nightly. Accelerometers and pedometers were attached to dams and calves, respectively, at d 5 postpartum. Milk production was recorded automatically twice daily from d 3 to d 19. Milk components, somatic cell score (SCS; TN DHIA Lab) and calf body weight were collected weekly. The MIXED procedure (SAS 9.4, Cary, NC) was used to evaluate the effect of treatment and calf sex on milk production, components, and dam and calf lying time and bouts. T-tests were conducted to evaluate the effect of treatment on average daily gain (ADG). Milk production was greater among dams housed without calves than dams housed with calves, respectively (30.3 ± 1.5 vs 26.0 ± 1.4 kg, P < 0.05). Milk fat, protein, and SCS did not differ between dam treatment groups. Lying behavior did not differ among calf or dam treatment groups. Calf ADG did not differ between treatment groups. Housing cows with calves did not negatively impact ADG, lying behavior, or milk components. Housing calves and dams together at 5 d postpartum may provide a potential opportunity to address societal concerns.","In the dairy industry, calves are often separated from their dams (mothers) within hours of birth, a practice which is often viewed negatively by the public. The objective of this study is to examine how housing calves and their dams together in pasture at night influences behavior, calf growth and health, and dam milk production as compared to calves and dams housed separately as in traditional dairy management. This could provide an opportunity to address societal concerns while maintaining dairy cattle welfare. "

ATRAM is a highly soluble peptide that partitions on the lipid membrane surface at neutral pH and will fold into the membrane as a transmembrane alpha helix at acidic conditions. Using biophysical techniques, we have furthered the understanding of the insertion pathway of ATRAM into lipid vesicles. Kinetic studies show that peptide insertion occurs in at least three separate steps, including the oligomerization, helix formation, and membrane insertion. We determined the membrane topology by evaluating the cellular uptake of fluorescently labeled ATRAM coupled to PEGylated liposomes. The results indicated that ATRAM inserted unidirectionally with its C-terminus across the lipid bilayer. In addition, by performing binding studies we have gained insight of binding cooperativity. Finally, mice studies demonstrated that ATRAM has an extended circulation half-life. Our data highlight the potential of ATRAM to be further developed as a specific therapeutic agent for diseases that lead to acidic tissues, including cancer.",The extracellular environment of a cancer cell has a pH that can be 1 unit lower than a healthy cell.  Our lab designs pH sensitive peptides that takes advantage of this acidity to target cancer cell with higher specificity and sensitivity. We use biophyiscal techniques to characterize the peptides and fine tune its potential to  as a specific therapeutic agent.

Although signaling pathways inside SCN neurons are known to regulate circadian neuronal activity, the involvement of extracellular-matrix (ECM) molecules in SCN clock phase regulation is unclear. Day vs. night differences in extracellular proteases and glial cell morphology in the SCN set precedent for the involvement of ECM proteins in regulating these changes. Two candidate proteins, MMP-2 and MMP-9, may link the ECM to circadian rhythm production in the SCN. Classically known as ECM remodelers, MMP-2/-9 can be activated when neuronal activity increases. MMP-2/-9 are also involved in regulating N-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activity, a critical element of the photic phase shifting pathway. We have shown differential effects of BiPS, an MMP-2/9 inhibitor, on the clock: BiPS induces time dependent phase shifts. Both advances and delays induced by BiPS are inhibited by the NMDA antagonist AP5, while only BiPS-induced daytime phase advances are inhibited by treatments upstream from TrkB activation. MMP-9 activity, in particular, is highest during the early night. This project aims to better understand the mechanism behind BiPS induced phase shifts by examining the cellular changes that occur after MMP-2/9 inhibition. Currently, I am using extracellular electrophysiology to examine acute effects of BiPS SCN neuronal firing rate in acute SCN brain slices prepared from C57Bl/6 male mice. It is known that MMP-2/9 activity can regulate transynaptic signaling via cleavage of synaptic adhesion molecules like β-dystroglycan and neuroligins. Thus, I am also using western blotting of SCN tissue to explore BiPS-induced changes scaffolding protein expression. Ultimately, the goal of this work is to determine if changes in the extracellular matrix, as regulated by MMP-2/9, affect the physiology of the predictably plastic circadian clock. ","The master clock of the brain, or suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), is responsible for keeping our behavior, physiology and metabolism in tune with the environment and synchronized to other body clocks. Our goal is to uncover how molecules outside of neurons, called extracellular matrix proteins, help cells in the SCN maintain their endogenous, near 24-hour rhythms in neuronal signaling. This presentation identifies key extracellular players and describes how the environment around neurons contributes to time keeping mechanisms. "

For cancer cell membranes are intrinsically more acidic due to their increased usage of lactic acid fermentation. However, there is still much to be learned about pHLIP. While much is known about its response to various pHs, little is known of pHLIP’s response to other chemical environments or how other strains of pHLIP may react. In this review, we attempt to understand the response of the strain CCpHLIP (Wild-type pHLIP with a double cysteine terminus) to varying ionic strength levels in both high pH and low pH environments through biophysical analysis. Testing how CCpHLIP interacts in various ionic strength environments will aid in determining the conditions of CCpHLIP’s pH- dependent insertion into membranes. This information can help us to more specifically determine CCpHLIP’s effectiveness at targeting cancer cells. ",Cancer cell membranes have a lower pH level than typical benign cells. There are a few peptides that have cancer-targeting properties (i.e. insert into membranes within the desired pH range of cancer cells). This presentation sheds light on some of the responses of these pH low insertion peptides in various environments.

The need for screening and awareness of the symptoms are the best ways of reducing the risk. Although, advances in screening and treatment have improved survival rates since 1989. Breast cancer screening aims at diagnosing a women’s breast for cancer before there are any signs and symptoms of the disease. Although breast cancer screening cannot prevent breast cancer but it can help in early diagnosis of the disease when it is easier to treat. Studies have shown that the risk for breast cancer is due to the combination of many different factors. Risk factors assessment is important for breast cancer screening and prevention. The screening programs and the risk factor assessment place the women into different categories such as low-risk, average-risk and high-risk. This study aims at examine the associations of these factors with breast cancer screening using principal component analysis (PCA) and regression analysis with principal component scores (PCS). Totally, 2184 women respondents were selected who have or who have not had cancer from the 2014 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS 4, Cycle 4). PCA was used to deal with multicollinearity of the risk factors and multiple logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the associations of potential factors and PCS with breast cancer screening. PCA showed that the first six principal components (PCs) for risk factors and demographic factors explained 91% of total variation. Multiple logistic regression analysis of principal component scores are underway to check for any associations with breast cancer screening. PCA is helpful in reducing the indicators in the complex survey data and PC scores of quitting smoking and tobacco use were associated with breast cancer screening.","Machine learning combined with data and powerful computing is helping to get meaningful insight in every field. Using machine learning algorithms on health data can help in better understanding of diseases and associated factors. My research is focused on pre-processing data, using regression and principal component analysis on data related to breast cancer patients and finding associated risk factors. "

Nitrogen is typically fixed to ammonium in soils and undergoes nitrification process. The denitrification process involving the metabolic reduction of nitrate leads to the production of nitrogen. The resulting nitrate can be denitrified to nitrogen or nitrous oxide. Utilization of N2O is attracting significant interest in the area of environmental remediation which is the focus of present research utilizing the organism known as Dechloromonas aromatica strain RCB (D. aromatica str. RCB).  Denitrifiers like D. aromatica str. RCB have unique attributes being: prototrophic, aerobic thriving and serving as a medium in the denitrification process for oxygen producing bacteria. In addition, the organisms have already found use in oxidizing benzene under oxygen-free conditions for sites contaminated with petroleum fuels. In this research, using unique microbial strain as a model organism, provided by Professor Löffler’s group at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, a series of experiments were performed to understand the denitrification processes catalyzed by these organisms for a variety of simulated conditions to optimize and to evaluate the efficacy for possible use in nitrous oxide control related applications. It is concluded that D. aromatica str. RCB is prototrophic, requiring no special nutrients for growth and growth is not possible under strict anaerobic conditions.",Reduction of Nitrous Oxide emissions is an important and essential complementary strategy to reduce the depletion of ozone layer and climate change in addition to the current focus on carbon control strategy.

An additional benefit is stormwater interception by urban trees which reduces and slows runoff reaching streams. Although urban tree hydrologic influence is a known benefit, a quantified set of their contributions is needed for more natural urban tree systems to be utilized and supported in urban settings. Therefore, this research quantifies the interception, throughfall, and stemflow for three common urban-environment trees in Knoxville, Tennessee. Three individual trees from each of the three selected tree species were identified so that in total nine trees were observed. Each of the nine trees has a system of three troughs each individually sloping down to a tipping bucket rain gauge under the tree canopy. This system acquires a sizable throughfall area under the tree and averages variability expected from changes in tree shape, canopy cover, and storm or wind direction. The stemflow mechanism consists of a silicon tube wrapped once around the tree trunk draining into a designated stemflow rain gauge. For comparison, an open canopy rain gauge is placed near each set of tree species. The expected result is for throughfall from the tree canopy to be less than the open canopy as well as increasing time of rainfall collection. The timing of rainfall accumulation under the trees with varying rain intensities is important to measure in order to demonstrate the amount urban trees improve rapid urban hydrologic response time. Evaluation of the effects from diverse rainfall intensity, rainfall depth, and season presents the variation important to understanding the hydrologic benefits of a single urban tree.",Urban hydrology is influenced by urban tree population slowing and reducing stormwater runoff. The quantitative amounts of these influences are currently being measured in three local Knoxville parks through trough and raingauge systems. The goal is to create a better understanding of the hydrologic benefits of urban trees.

Urban runoff and stormwater is one of the top ten leading causes of water quality impairment in lakes, estuaries and streams in the United States (USEPA 2004). Over the last decade, bioretention systems have become a leading stormwater control measure (SCM) that contributes to the restoration of urban streams and watersheds. Bioretention cells increase infiltration of stormwater thereby reducing urban runoff volumes and peak flows which alter the hydrology of local waterways. Modeling of bioretention allows designers to better optimize the function of bioretention cells, provide guidance for design standards, and scale local impacts to the larger watershed.  However, current hydrologic models with bioretention capabilities consist of lumped parameters and simplifications that do not fully account for fundamental hydrologic processes. DRAINMOD is an agricultural drainage model that has shown promise when applied to bioretention systems. It has the capability of using the soil-water characteristic curve to obtain detailed water balances over a continuous time period (both advances over other models for bioretention). However, because DRAINMOD was designed for agricultural purposes, it cannot currently accommodate the rapid response time of an urban runoff hydrograph, instead aggregating data to a daily timeframe.  For this study, DRAINMOD has been recoded to allow high temporal resolution inputs and outputs, more closely matching the travel times of urban systems. DRAINMOD simulations were conducted both with and without the time scale modifications (original vs. bioretention-specific model) to determine if improvements in site-scale modeling were realized. Future work will compare these results to those of simplistic, lumped-parameter bioretention modeling. ",The use of bioretention systems for stormwater management has become a billion dollar industry in recent years. Modeling of these systems allows designers to optimize the system and understand the potential benefits prior to investing time and money into bioretention projects. Our research examines DRAINMOD for bioretention modeling. DRAINMOD improves the simulation of physical processes such as infiltration but requires modifications to utilize a time-scale more appropriate for urban settings.

Raptors are an excellent indicator of environmental contamination of T. gondii given their predatory and scavenging behavior. We investigated the seroprevelance of T. gondii in several raptor species from Florida and East Tennessee followed by parasite bioassay on select seropositive samples. From a total of 49 raptors, we found 8 (16%) to be seropositive via the modified agglutination test (MAT). The seropositive raptors consisted of five red-shouldered hawks, two eastern screech owls, and one barred owl. Seronegative raptors consisted of 13 red shouldered hawks, eight barred owls, seven eastern screech owls, five Cooper's hawks, three red-tailed hawks, two Great-horned owls, two ospreys, and one sharp-shinned hawk. Five of the seropositive raptors were from Florida, while the other three were from Knox County in Tennessee. Mice bioassay attempts using fresh brain and/or heart tissue was performed on 5 of the 8 seropositive birds.  We successfully isolated T. gondii tachyzoites from one red-shouldered hawk. Further research is still needed to investigate the prevalence of T. gondii in the raptors in the U.S. and to obtain a better understanding of the parasite life cycle, wildlife population impacts, and transmission dynamics.

Operational state inferences are important in the assessment of nuclear facilities’ compliance with safeguards agreements, critical to nonproliferation, safety, and security. We study several classification fusers within the areas of pattern recognition, statistics, information fusion, and machine learning. Specifically, fusers based on simple majority rule, Chow's pattern recognition, Fisher's combined probability test, physics-based Poisson distributed models, correlation coefficient method, and machine learning non-linear classifiers. These techniques combine measurements from multiple gas effluents, collected at a facility's ventilation stack, to infer on/off state; and our results show that physics-based detection methods are effective for this purpose. Expanding on physics-based fusers, we develop intensity-estimation Sequential Probability Ratio Tests (SPRT) and apply these methods to radiation counts collected by a network of sensors with fixed known locations. The network is deployed around a facility's stack and the intensity of gas emissions decays with distance. Sensor measurements are inherently random with parameters determined by the height of the stack and the radiation intensity at a sensor’s location. Our results show: (i) gas effluents are effective in inferring on/off state of a reactor facility, and (ii) fusers that combine multiple effluent types based on physics-based models, correlation coefficient, and Fisher's method outperform simple majority rule, Chow's fuser, and machine learning methods. We quantify the performance improvements of intensity-estimation SPRT methods over fixed thresholds SPRTs. Furthermore, we demonstrate the superior detection of single-source and multi-source sensor network fusers over individual sensors and majority-vote fusers.

Biology Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs) teach over 91% of freshman Biology labs and discussions nationally, yet the impacts of graduate student teaching anxiety and the effect on student learning is not well studied. GTA teaching anxiety could have broad influences on the quality of undergraduate education. In this yearlong longitudinal study, we investigated Biology GTA teaching anxiety at a large research-intensive southeastern university. This study used validated surveys and interviews to: (1) capture the current state of teaching anxiety of Biology GTAs; and (2) determine the causes and consequences of this anxiety over a full academic year. Fifty-nine GTAs across three Biology departments responded to surveys from Fall 2016 to Spring 2017. Though we did not find a significant difference in anxiety between two semesters, splitting the GTAs into below and above average anxiety groups (i.e. ""low"" <65 and ""high"" >65 anxieties) yielded a significant difference (t = 6.37, p<0.001). Building multiple linear regressions for low and high anxiety groups in Spring 2017, we found that self-efficacy was the most important variable in predicting teaching anxiety, however, each group coped differently. Low anxiety groups cope through employing positive thoughts (R2= 0.51, p <0.01, n=26) and high anxiety groups fail to have a significant coping strategy (R2= 0.25, p <0.01, n=30). By continuing to track GTAs, we can determine how self-efficacy, preparation, and identity of GTAs impact teaching anxiety. Results from this study will inform future teaching professional development activities for GTAs, and encourage greater awareness and dialogue about mental health issues in academia.","Graduate students in the United States have been suffering from increased anxiety over the last several decades affecting not only the overall mental health of graduate students, but also reducing retention in graduate programs.

Tulane virus (TV) is a cultivable HuNoV surrogate used to determine HuNoV inactivation methods. Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) gas, a strong oxidizer, is being researched to determine antiviral effects against foodborne viruses. The objective of this study was to determine the ability of ClO2 gas to inactivate HuNoV GII and TV on formica surfaces at room temperature. HuNoV GII and TV preconditioned on formica coupons for 15 min were treated with 4 and 8 mg/L ClO2 gas for 0, 1, 3, 5, and 8 min at 25°C and ~85% relative humidity. Viruses were recovered using Tris-glycine-beef extract buffer. HuNoV GII was detected by RNA heat-release and SYBR Green I-based RT-PCR with previously published MON primers and TV was detected by plaque assays. Each experiment was carried out in duplicate and replicated thrice. HuNoV GII, at initial 6 log RT-PCR units, was reduced by 1, 2, and 3 logs (based on end-point dilution) with 4 mg/L ClO2 gas. TV showed reductions of 1.16 log after 1 min and to non-detectable levels (≥5 log) after 3 min with the higher 8 mg/L ClO2 gas concentration. ClO2 gas treatments show promise in preventing HuNoV GII transmission and outbreaks.","Human noroviruses (HuNoV) are currently the most important foodborne viral pathogens with regard to the number of outbreaks (resulting in 58% of foodborne enteric viral outbreaks) and the number of people affected each year (5.5 million)  in the U.S. alone.

Campylobacteriosis is commonly associated with the consumption of poultry, meat, and raw milk. East Tennessee counties experience a higher prevalence of illness compared to other regions of the state based upon Tennessee Department of Health surveillance. The purpose of this study was to determine the presence of Campylobacter spp. in food stuffs, animal feces, and rivers from East Tennessee to better understand possible vehicles for campylobacteriosis in the region. Samples (n=258) were collected from local farmers’ markets, processing facilities, and rivers.

Baker Center Rotunda,9:00 - 11:00,09:00,Sarah Cooper,Cooper,14G,Genome Science and Technology,Substrate binding promotes catalysis in Toho-1 beta-lactamase,"Bacteria are developing resistance to antibiotics at an alarming rate. Mechanisms of resistance include decreasing drug permeability, increasing active efflux, protein target modification, and enzymatic inactivation. Enzymatic inactivation is often the preferred mechanism of resistance, as enzymes can catalyze chemical transformations that inactivate an entire class of antibiotics. The most extensively studied enzymatic inactivation mechanism is the inactivation of beta-lactam antibiotics by beta-lactamase enzymes (BLs). This type of resistance is now widespread and spans several families of BLs, posing a threat to the efficacy of a vital class of antibiotics and contributing to the global problem of antibiotic resistance. It is important to understand the catalytic mechanisms of these enzymes to develop strategies for overcoming BLs. The mechanism for class A BL has been studied extensively and involves nucleophilic attack of Ser70 on the β-lactam ring. However, the protonation states of key active site residues are often not definitively known. Using X-ray and neutron structures of Toho-1 β-lactamase with the cephalosporin antibiotic cefotaxime, a pre-covalent complex was obtained and the protonation states of key active site residues were observed directly. To determine the effect of the substrate on the initial proton transfer step of this reaction, we used quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) free energy simulations to calculate the free energy profiles of the proton transfer from Lys73 to Glu166 through Ser70 and an active site water molecule in both the apo and cefotaxime bound enzyme. We found that this proton transfer reaction is more thermodynamically favorable in the presence of cefotaxime. Thus, cefotaxime contributes to its own catalysis by altering the pKas of Lys73 and Glu166 prior to acylation. This understanding the mechanistic details of this proton transfer at the atomic level will aid in the rational design of novel antibiotics.","In recent years, the global problem of antibiotic resistance by Gram-negative bacteria has been on the rise. Meanwhile, few new antibiotics are being developed to help treat bacterial infections.

Readiness is purportedly gauged by ratings of fatigue, mood/emotional state, body discomfort/injury, and hydration status. It is unclear if such factors predict aerobic exercise behavior in free-living adults. Our purpose was to assess relationships between hypothesized readiness factors and bouts of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) lasting 30+ min. 29 participants (16 female, 24(6)y) completed the study. Ecological momentary assessment of perceived fatigue, mood, hydration, discomfort, and exercise self-efficacy was conducted by sending four text prompts per day for 14 days. Texts contained active survey links. MVPA was assessed using waist-worn accelerometry set at 30 Hz. Data (60-second epochs) were analyzed using Freedson 1998 cut points. Bouts were assessed if recorded durations were 30+ min. Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS. Within-day effects were tested using multilevel linear mixed models to examine lagged effects of readiness factors/exercise self-efficacy during a time block (T-1) on minutes of bouted MVPA during the subsequent time block (T). Exercise self-efficacy was the only significant predictor of bouted MVPA (t=4.31, p=0.0002). Concurrent analyses demonstrated a significant relationship between fatigue and exercise self-efficacy (t=-4.40, p<0.0001) within a given time block. Fatigue was also concurrently related to mood state (t=-12.73, p<0.0001) and discomfort (t=20.85, p<0.0001). Hydration was not significantly related to fatigue (t=-1.80, p=0.0713). While hypothesized readiness factors did not directly predict minutes of bouted MVPA, their significant concurrent relationships with exercise self-efficacy lend some support to their importance in individuals’ daily decisions to engage in bouted MVPA in natural conditions. ","According to the American College of Sports Medicine, engaging in aerobic moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) for at least 150 minutes/week can result in long-lasting health benefits that could reduce health care burden due to chronic, non-communicable disease in the United States.

The cells were fed either alpha Minimum Essential Medium (αMEM) or the differentiation media supplemented with 10 nmol/L dexamethasone, 10 mmol/L β-glycerophosphate, and 50 μg/mL ascorbic acid. One sample was fixed and another sample’s cells were collected and stored at -80oC on days 6, 12, and 18. Total RNA was extracted from the frozen cell pellets, and cDNA was created from these RNA samples. The cDNA samples were subjected to real-time PCR using glyceraldehyde alcohol dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a housekeeping gene. GAPDH expression confirmed the success of our technique and the quality of the RNA obtained. The fixed samples were stained with Alizarin red reagent. The Alizarin red was eluted using a mixture of 20% methanol and 10 % acetic acid and was used to quantitate the amount of mineralization which correlates to the differentiation state of the samples. This showed a significantly higher number of differentiated cells in the day 21 differentiated sample compared to the undifferentiated day 21 sample. Future experiments will evaluate the expression of osteocalcin and osteopontin, two osteogenic-specific genes, to test for the differentiation of the cells. If successful, the cells will next be grown on Gelfoam (a commercially available material commonly used in human oral/maxillofacial medicine) to test whether the material improves the differentiation of cells. Future experiments can be expanded to mesenchymal stem cells as well as other biomaterials. ","To heal a bone defect, the body must alter preexisting cells or utilize externally added mesenchymal stem cells; known as osteogenesis, the mesenchymal stem cells differentiate to rebuild the bone. One method to evaluate bone regeneration is to monitor the differentiation of the externally added mesenchymal stem cells.

Previous work in Appalachia showed that young adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) face unique challenges and disparities related to living with T1D. However, there is no information about the experience of young adults with type 2 diabetes and the possible challenges that they may encounter in Appalachia. This study aimed to explore the experience of young Appalachian adults living with type 2 diabetes in Tennessee. Over a period of 18 months, 3 young women (18-30 years old), were recruited for the study. Data was collected via in-depth individual interview and analyzed using qualitative content analysis approach. Findings highlighted five main themes including; living with diabetes is difficult, I cannot afford healthy food, it is not a serious condition, people are ignorant, and diabetes is my fault. Based on the findings the most difficult aspects of living with diabetes were associated with public stigma and their poverty for diabetes self-care. In addition, they frequently mentioned that their condition is not serious as T1D is. Individual and community education can increase awareness about T2D. This awareness can also decrease stigmatization toward T2D mainly related to obesity that participants internalized it as “diabetes is my fault”.  A more aware community and individuals with T2D will help to understand the importance of sufficient diabetes self-care to improve quality of life and prevent diabetes complications. ","Living with diabetes is a unique challenge for young adults specifically for those living in Appalachia, an underserved area.

Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is a cytosolic enzyme whose inhibition has beneficial effects, but its role in podocytes remains unexplored. To that end, we generated mice with specific deletion of sEH in podocyte (pod-sEHKO) and determined alterations under normoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Pod-sEHKO mice exhibited mild improvement in renal function and glucose homeostasis at normoglycemia. Under hyperglycemia, pod-sEHKO mice displayed significant improvement in renal function and glucose homeostasis, and attenuation of hyperglycemia-induced increase in blood pressure. In addition, sEH deficiency protected podocyte structure against hyperglycemia-induced injury. Consistent with the improved glucose homeostasis, pod-sEHKO mice displayed decreased gluconeogenesis and increased glucosuria under hyperglycemia. Moreover, podocyte sEH deficiency was associated with decreased renal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and enhanced autophagy with corresponding decrease in inflammation and fibrosis. Furthermore, these effects were recapitulated in cultured differentiated podocytes treated with a sEH pharmacological inhibitor. Notably, elevation of ER stress or attenuation of autophagy mitigated the protective effects of sEH inhibition demonstrating causal association. Importantly, sEH pharmacological inhibition in vivo improved renal function and glucose homeostasis and attenuated hyperglycemia-induced increase in blood pressure. These findings establish sEH in podocytes as a significant contributor to renal function and identify sEH as a potential therapeutic target for podocytopathies.","Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of renal failure, and podocyte dysfunction plays a significant role in DN pathogenesis.

To solve this problem, transgenic switchgrass plants containing altered levels of lignin have been developed by genetic manipulation. However, lignin is an important component of soil organic matter (SOM). Plant residues with altered cell wall lignin might alter overall soil quality by affecting soil carbon and nutrient cycling. We hypothesized that soils planted with transgenic switchgrass impact SOM cycling differently than soils planted with non-transgenic switchgrass. We collected soil samples from two transgenic switchgrass experimental trials at the East Tennessee AgResearch and Education Center in Knoxville. Both trials included replicates of transgenic and non-transgenic switchgrass plants. Preliminary results indicate no difference in total SOM between transgenic and non-transgenic plots. Detailed examination is currently being undertaken on potentially mineralizable carbon content and microbially respired carbon to carbon dioxide. This research is expected to provide comprehensive understanding of the effect of genetically modified biofuel feedstock plants on soil processes leading to sustainability of production systems.","Though switchgrass has great potential as a bioenergy feedstock, the high lignin content in its cell wall tissue is a barrier to its manufacture.

Having a more widespread use of these fuel cell is a desired alternative to current means of producing energy that are unsustainable and detrimental to our environment. One of the major disadvantages of low temperature fuel cells is the high cost associated with using platinum group metals (PGMs) as the catalysts for the reactions taking place at both the anode and cathode electrodes. In particular, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) that takes place at the cathode electrode is very slow and requires higher loadings of Pt catalyst. Replacing Pt with non-PGM catalyst would significantly decrease the cost of fuel cells and allow their mass production and implementation. In this work we show the synthesis of a novel non-PGM catalyst that uses raw biomass obtained from local trees as the carbon support precursor. The biomass carbon precursor is mixed with an iron salt and a nitrogen rich compound to create the catalysts materials. In this work we studied the catalysts performance as we varied different synthesis parameters, such as heat treatment temperature, amount of metal added and pretreatment of the raw biomass, among others. Performance was studied using the rotating ring disk electrode method, an electrochemical technique that measures the catalyst activity towards the ORR and determines if oxygen is being reduced directly to water, which is the desired reaction path.","Low temperature fuel cells are electrochemical devices that generate energy in a clean manner, however the cost of the platinum typically used as a catalyst at the anode and cathode electrodes make the fuel cells expensive.

The proton exchange membrane that separates the negative and positive electrodes is a fundamental part of the system, since it allows the diffusion of H+ ions between electrodes to make possible the oxidation/reduction reactions in the half-cells. In VRFBs the membrane electrolyte is desired to have high proton conductivity, low vanadium permeability to avoid battery discharge caused by vanadium crossover and good durability. The most common membrane used in VRFBs has been Nafion due to its success in fuel cells. However, in a VRFB the working environment differs greatly from that of a fuel cell, for example, the membrane can adsorb electrolyte species other than protons and the high electrolyte concentration will tend to dehydrate the membrane. These conditions can substantially affect the membrane’s conductivity as well as other transport properties. In the flow battery, the trade-off between membrane conductivity and species transport across the membrane is key and is largely driven by the tendency of the membrane to imbibe different solution components as well as their intrinsic mobility. Our group has developed a core set of measurements for membrane characterization that includes conductivity, porosity, acid, water and vanadium uptake, and vanadium permeability. In this work we studied a series of ionomer membranes provided by 3M conditioned in solutions of different concentrations of sulfuric acid and vanadium.

PSI is the photosynthetic protein complex that acts as a nano-scale biological photodiode and allows for light-activated charge separation to facilitate unidirectional electron flow. This light-activated charge separation has nearly 100% quantum efficiency. The structural and photo-electrochemical properties of PSI allow it to be suitable for incorporation into bio-electronic or hybrid photochemical devices. Prior to this advancement, the first step towards the rational design of such revolutionary devices requires a fundamental understanding of the morphological and electronic properties of PSI on various donor substrates/electrodes. This aspect sparked the interest of STM research. Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) is a powerful scanning-probe technique that allows simultaneous high-resolution analysis of localized topography and charge transport properties of at atomistic resolution. To this end, preparation of quality STM tips is critical in acquiring high quality images and in turn tunneling current of PSI nanostructures. Such demand for high-precision STM tips has launched the exploration of many techniques used to produce STM tips with uniform and controlled tip radius and geometry. These methods are marked by parameters which demand specific configurations.

The limited sources of Li now make this metal strategically important. Natural sources of Li include spodemene minerals and salt-lake brines. Spodumene is mined primarily in Australia, and then shipped to China, where it is then processed into battery-grade lithium carbonate. Lithium also is obtained from salt-lake brines, concentrated in salt form through solar evaporation in South America. Both of these processes for securing Li are costly and time-consuming. A new method is now being developed to extract Li from salt-lake brines, using well-crafted sorbents. A Li sorbent is a material that extracts Li ions selectively from an aqueous solution, while leaving other ions, such as sodium, calcium and potassium, in solution.  When absorption sites on the sorbent are loaded with Li, the Li can be desorbed by rinsing the sorbent with Deionized-H2O. Our project focused on synthesizing pure and iron-doped Lithium-Aluminum Layered Double Hydroxide Chloride, xLiCl*2Al(OH)3*mH2O (Li/Al LDH). Li/Al LDH is highly selective for Li, and should be readily scalable to industry needs. We also synthesized and tested 3 manganese-based sorbents. For large-scale synthesis of Li/Al LDH, we determined concentration, time, and quantity needed in a 750-ml capacity batch reactor. We successfully synthesized ~ 200 g of Li/Al LDH in a single batch. X-ray diffraction data revealed the presence of a single LDH phase. We are currently testing Li sorption from bine solutions through Li concentration measurements made by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. By scaling the Li/Al LDH sorbent process to pilot-scale production, American industries can now better meet the rapidly increasing demand for Li. We synthesized over 1 kg of Li/Al LDH for our industry partner.","With an increased reliance of lithium-ion batteries in current and emerging technologies, new methods are needed to meet the growing lithium demand.

With high power density, long lifecycle and a bridging function, supercapacitors have features that are highly prized for energy conversion and storage. However, supercapacitors are relatively costly to construct and compared to batteries – they provide a low energy density. To increase energy density and reduce production cost, we explored the possibility of using two-dimensional materials (such as graphene oxide) as electrodes in electrochemical supercapacitors. Our research focused on using flexible transparent polymer substrates, transparent electrodes, and electrolytes, which can enable new supercapacitor designs for technology integration while providing a large reduction in cost. The electrochemical performance of the flexible and transparent devices was tested by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. These measurements confirmed the charge storage by electrical double layer formation in our devices, and effective charge propagation across the two electrodes. In our experiments we have explored two electrolyte systems (1) poly(vinyl alcohol)H3PO4 (PVA-H3PO4), and (2) poly(vinyl phosphonic acid)- H3PO4 (PVPA-H3PO4). The latter is expected to offer better ion conductivity because it has additional phosphoric groups in the electrolyte system. Thus, we hypothesize that the PVPA- H3PO4 system can provide higher capacitive performance compared to PVA-H3PO4 based devices. In future efforts, we plan to increase areal capacitance and energy density of our devices by optimizing both electrode and electrolyte processing protocols to be viable for a variety of practical applications requiring flexible and transparent energy management devices.","Alternative energy storage and conversion devices are on high demand due to the need for high power and high energy densities.

PSI is similar in mechanism to the more common electrospray ionization (ESI), in which solution phase ions are transferred to the gas phase via an electrospray produced by the application of high electric fields. In PSI, sample solution is desorbed from a wetted triangular shaped paper substrate. PSI is valuable in portable, low cost MS instrumentation because it does not require sample flow, as ESI does, and the paper substrates used for PSI are extremely low cost. The lack of flow in PSI prevents complex sample manipulations that are common in ESI, such as sample preconcentration. This is a significant drawback since ion yields can often be low from PSI compared to ESI.

Neurological diseases are not often diagnosed until considerable damage has already occurred, and treatment becomes less beneficial. Current diagnosis methods involving monitoring neurotransmitter concentrations are highly invasive, requiring holes to be drilled in the skull. Biofluids such as urine and blood can be probed as an alternative, however, the process is time consuming, often nonselective, and in the case of blood, still invasive. Due to its high selectivity and rapid sample processing, Raman spectroscopy is a useful technique for identifying these biomarkers, but the signal obtained is inherently weak. In order to combat this inherently weak signal, surface enhance Raman spectroscopy (SERS) can be employed. SERS uses a property of noble metal nanoparticles called the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) where an electric field is induced by the collective oscillations of the electrons on the nanoparticle surface when excited with a laser. The enhanced Raman signal produced with SERS allows for the detection of biomarkers within the physiologically relevant concentration range. Collecting signal through the dense human skull is an obstacle that can be overcome by combining SERS with spatially offset Raman spectroscopy (SORS), which enables the probing of biomolecules through diffusely scattering materials. Using this method, called surface enhanced spatially offset Raman spectroscopy (SESORS), we present the detection of neurotransmitters injected into a brain mimic through an animal skull.","The detection of biomarkers early in the progression of neurological disease is needed, where treatment would be most effective.

Hydraulic fracturing requires 2 to 10 million gallons of water per well fractured. To perform a successful fracture, hydraulic fracturing companies add additives to the water and inject these fluids into wellbores. The fluids contain water, proppants, and various chemical additives for various purposes, including reducing friction, decreasing viscosity and breaking agents. Oxidizers, such as persulfate, are routinely used as breaking agents to degrade gelling agents and clean wellbores. Persulfate oxidation is promoted, or activated, through heating, pH adjustments, and transition metals present in hydraulic fracturing fluids and shale formations. Understanding the interactions between this powerful oxidant and shale under hydraulic fracturing conditions is important. Previous studies have investigated the impact of synthetic hydraulic fracturing fluid on shale; however, no observations were made for persulfate and organic additives, which may cause further precipitation and demineralization of chemical species. As shale constituents and organic additives react with persulfate, more toxic and environmentally threatening contaminants may be produced; therefore, establishing these interactions is imperative to understanding the environmental consequences caused by hydraulic fracturing practices. This research investigates the impact of synthetic hydraulic fracturing fluid containing persulfate and organic additives on shale physical/chemical properties, including particle size and chemical composition. As changes in shale characteristics influence wastewater quality, the information gained from this study may be used to develop treatment technologies for promoting wastewater reuse, thus alleviating water requirements.","Hydraulic fracturing companies use 2 to 10 million gallons of water to perform a successful fracture; to all of this water, 200,000 L of chemicals are added.

In this work, an alternative approach based on a hierarchical decomposition of the radial distribution function is used to generate a physics-based model allowing rapid interpretation of scattering data. In order to demonstrate the breadth of this approach, it is applied to a series of carbon composites. The model is compared to atomistic simulation results in order to demonstrate that the contributions of the crystalline and amorphous domains, as well as their interfaces, are correctly captured. Because the model is more efficient, additional structural refinement is performed to increase the agreement of the simulation result with the experimental data. This model provides quantitative and qualitative insight into the structure of the composite by parameterization of the crystallite size and volume fraction of crystalline and amorphous phases. We intend to include a total model for three lignin carbon processed conditions (1000°C, 1500°C, and 2000°C) to introduce the structural changes in one specimen.","A computationally efficient tool, based on the natural hierarchical structure present in composite materials, containing crystalline and amorphous domains, is demonstrated to rapidly extract structural information without the need of high performance computing resources. This work presents a model of lignin carbon composites materials processed at conditions of 1000 °C, 1500 °C, and 2000 °C."

Heterostructures comprising ferromagnetic metallic CoFe layer on top of ferroelectric BiFeO3 (BFO) has recently shown evidence of strong ME coupling at room temperature. However, these devices suffer from limited switching cycles due to distortion at the CoFe/BFO interface. In this work, we investigate an amorphous Fe-Dy-Tb oxide (FDTO) thin film as the ferromagnetic layer to couple to the underlying BFO. Amorphous FDTO has been shown to possess a combination of low sheet resistance (<200 ohm/sq) and room temperature magnetism with moment of around 50 emu/cc. The FDTO films were deposited by pulsed laser deposition on top of epitaxially grown BFO films at room temperature, in the presence of an in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic field, under varying oxygen pressures. The amorphous microstructure and surface oxidation of FDTO was confirmed by diffraction and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy respectively. The magnetic measurements demonstrated an increase in the coercive field of FDTO from about 200 Oe on quartz substrate to 1300 Oe on BFO films. The ferroelectric property of BFO was found to be retained for 108 switching cycles with the FDTO as a top electrode, a major outcome of this research. Various spintronic device structures are being investigated to provide evidence for ME coupling in FDTO/BFO heterostructures. Besides providing an alternative material for the ME coupling in multiferroic devices, FDTO could also be an innovative material for various spintronic applications.","The ability to modulate the magnetic spin of a material using an electric field, termed magneto-electric (ME) coupling, is an effective way to reduce energy consumption of memory devices; however, most ME coupling has been shown to occur at temperatures well below the typical operational temperature of such devices. Our research has developed a novel amorphous ferromagnet, Fe-Tb-Dy-oxide (FDTO), that has potential application in electronics, including memory devices. This poster describes the electrical and magnetic properties of FDTO and presents initial ME coupling data at room temeprature from FDTO/Bismuth Ferrite heterostructures."

HEA nanoparticles were formed by a top-down synthesis approach and condensed into paste. Shear strength testing of joints formed by brazing revealed the nanopaste gave similar mechanical properties to joints brazed with a bulk sample of the HEA, but with a lower temperature threshold. The nanopaste and bulk metal achieve maximum bonding strength near the liquidus temperature of the HEA. Far above this temperature, the strength suffers due to excessive diffusion of the filler and base metals. Cr in the nanopaste was observed to migrate toward the base metal ahead of other constituents during diffusion, suggesting a phase change of the HEA contributes to the bonding strength.","High entropy alloys are those which contain 5 or more different metals, and their properties suggest they would mechanically perform well when used to make joints. Our research aims to take advantage of these properties by brazing, or welding with a metal sandwiched between plates, using one of these alloys in nanoparticle form for joining."

Film density was calculated using the thickness and weight of the film, X-ray diffraction revealed the average grain size and film texture and surface roughness was measured using atomic force microscopy. Micromechanical resonator structures were patterned in the NCD film via photolithography and dry etching.

Corrinoids share a corrin ring to which a purinyl, benzimidazolic, or phenolic lower base structure is connected via a nucleotide loop. Only certain Bacteria and Archaea produce the corrinoids needed by a multitude of other organisms, including humans. Corrinoid-auxotrophic Dehalococcoides mccartyi (Dhc) strains completely degrade toxic and carcinogenic organochlorine contaminants to environmentally benign products. The types of corrinoid (i.e., corrinoids with different lower base structures) generated by the microbial community affect Dhc growth and reductive dechlorination rates and extents. In this study, the type and the quantity of corrinoid(s) produced under different biogeochemical conditions are being investigated. Chlorinated solvent-dechlorinating enrichment cultures were derived from sediment collected from Third Creek in Knoxville, Tennessee and aquifer material and groundwater obtained from the Commerce Street Superfund site in Vermont. Starting from dechlorinating parent cultures, subcultures were maintained under nitrate-reducing, ferric iron-reducing, sulfate-reducing, acetogenic, and methanogenic conditions. Corrinoid analysis demonstrated that the biogeochemical conditions affect the type and the quantity of corrinoid(s) produced.

Petit Havana with giant chloroplasts,"Transgene confinement of genetically modified plants has proven to be a taxing challenge for plant biotechnology. Chloroplasts, however, have their own genome in multiple copies per plastid, which is exclusively maternally inherited in most plant species. Genetic engineering of the chloroplast genome can provide high levels of gene expression without silencing. Despite these benefits, chloroplast transformation remains extremely inefficient. Recent studies have shown that over expression of AtFtsZ1, a gene responsible for regulating chloroplast division in Arabidopsis, can produce an abnormally large chloroplast known as a macrochloroplast. These enlarged chloroplasts provide a larger target for transformation and may help increase chloroplast transformation efficiencies. In this project, we overexpressed AtFtsZ1 in Nicotiana tabacum cv. Petit Havana via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, which produced plants that exhibited the desired macrochloroplast phenotype. Plastid transformation was then performed using a chloroplast transformation vector containing the PpsbA and Prrn native chloroplast promoters which drive expression of a green fluorescent protein reporter gene and the aadA spectinomycin resistance gene, respectively. The results of this project are aimed to assess whether macrochloroplasts might be useful for more facile tobacco chloroplast transformation with the ultimate goal of translating chloroplast transformation to other species.","Transgene confinement via chloroplast transformation has proven to be a promising avenue for the progression of plant biotechnology due to their exclusively maternally inherited genome.

I-House Great Room,1:00 - 3:00,13:00,Meredith Denney,Denney,41U,Psychology,Borderline personality traits and alcohol use as risk factors for compulsive sexual behavior among college students,"Extensive research suggested borderline personality disorder (BPD) traits (e.g. fear of abandonment, unpredictable relationships, impulsivity, unstable self-image, emotion dysregulation) positively relate to compulsive sexual behaviors (CSB), defined as the excessive desire or drive of sexual behavior, masturbation, engagement in sexual fantasy, utilization of pornography and sexual internet videos and chats. Prior research indicated that co-occurring substance use among individuals with BPD traits results in increased impulsivity and behavioral consequences associated with BPD, which may include CSB. Furthermore, substance use increased the risk for CSB. It follows that alcohol use may increase the likelihood of CSB among individuals with BPD traits. However, prior research has yet to investigate this interaction. We hypothesized that the relationship between BPD traits and CSB would be strengthened by increased alcohol use and problems. Self-report, cross-sectional survey data were collected from a sample of 256 college students (56.11% female). The Personality Diagnostic Questionnaie-4 Borderline Personality Disorder Scale (PDQ-4) assessed BPD traits. To measure alcohol use and problems we used the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). The Sexual Addiction Screening Test-Revised (SAST-R) Core subscale assessed CSB. A t-test revealed that men and women’s CSB scores were not significantly different. Our hypothesis was supported: the addition of the interaction term predicted additional variance in CSB scores, F(3, 252) = 18.40, p < .00. That is, BPD traits positively related to CSB for college students with high (β = .58, p < .00) and mean (β  = .39, p < .00), but not low (β  = .19, ns) levels of alcohol use and problems. Further research implications will be discussed.","Through self-report, cross-sectional survey methodology, results suggested that borderline personality disorder (BPD) traits positively related to compulsive sexual behaviors (CSB) among college men and women with high and mean, but not low, levels of alcohol use and problems."

The Intersensory Redundancy Hypothesis states the synchronous and redundant presentation of multimodal stimuli selectively recruits infant attention to and facilitates processing of amodal stimulus properties. Monolingual English learning infants viewed either synchronous (redundant) or asynchronous (non-redundant) video clips of a woman speaking in English (native speech) or Spanish (non-native speech). Halfway through each trial, the speaker changed affect from adult-directed speech to infant-directed speech or vice versa. Participants completed four 1-min trials. Order of presentation was counter-balanced. Infant scanning patterns were measured using an EyeLink 1000 Plus. We hypothesized that intersensory redundancy would direct infant attention to amodal properties of speech and facilitate discrimination of a change in affect. Specifically, we predicted infants viewing synchronous videos would demonstrate differential scanning based on a change in affect on both English and Spanish trials. In contrast, we predicted infants in the asynchronous condition would only demonstrate differential scanning patterns based on change in affect on English trials. The findings revealed differential scanning patterns across groups and conditions.  Infants in the synchronous condition spent a greater proportion of each trial fixated on the mouth area, whereas infants in the asynchronous condition spent a greater proportion of each trial fixated on the nose area. These findings highlight the role of intersensory redundancy in directing infant selective attention to amodal stimulus properties. ","This research examines how infant attention to audiovisual speech is dependent on an interaction of various factors. Such factors include the speaker using infant-directed speech (""baby-talk"") or adult-directed speech (a more neutral tone of voice), the audio synchronizing with the video or playing asychronous to the video (intersensory redundancy), and the speaker speaking in a native (English) or non-native (Spanish) language. Results show infant-directed speech helps draw attention to the mouth of the speaker, and the combination of infant-directed speech, synchrony (presence of intersensory redundancy), and prior exposure to the language (native speaker) facilitates infants' ability to notice a change from adult-directed speech to infant-directed speech.

Interestingly, male hamsters with dominant social status exhibit elevated plasma testosterone, increased androgen receptor expression in the medial amygdala (MeA) and ventral lateral septum (vLS), and less defeat-induced social avoidance compared to subordinates and controls. The objective of this study was to investigate whether dominant female hamsters show changes in testosterone concentration, androgen receptor expression, and defeat-induced social avoidance. Adult female hamsters were matched according to their estrous cycle and paired in 12 daily social encounters to establish dominance relationships. To avoid dyadic encounters when females were in estrous, we skipped encounters every 4 days. Male hamsters were similarly paired in dominant/subordinate dyads for 12 days. Blood was collected from both male and female subjects prior to and 15 min following their first dominance encounter. After the final dominance encounter, animals experienced acute social defeat stress and 24 hours later received a social interaction test with a same-sex, unfamiliar, confined hamster. While acute social defeat stress produced social avoidance in both male and female hamsters, social status altered social avoidance and plasma testosterone in males but not females. Whether social status alters the expression of androgen and estrogen receptors in the MeA and vLS will also be addressed. These findings suggest the neuroendocrine mechanisms controlling the effects of social status on defeat-induced changes in behavior in male hamsters do not generalize to female hamsters. This line of research improves our understanding of the neuroendocrine mechanisms regulating sex differences in vulnerability to stress-related mental illness. ","Understanding the neuroendocrine mechanisms that support stress resilience is an early step toward developing more effective treatment options for patients who suffer from stress-related psychopathologies.

In light of Wagenmakers et al.’s (2016) failure to replicate Strack, Martin, and Stepper’s (1988) seminal demonstration of facial feedback effects, we conducted a meta-analysis on 286 effect sizes derived from 136 facial feedback studies. Results reveal that the overall effect of facial feedback on emotional experience was small but significant (d = .20, p < .000000005). In addition, five standard metrics suggested that these results were not driven by publication bias. Moderator analyses indicated that facial feedback can influence ratings of emotional experience, but may not influence evaluative judgments. Furthermore, facial feedback effects on emotional experience are larger in the absence of emotionally evocative stimuli (e.g., cartoons), and for some emotions (e.g., happiness) than others (e.g., fear). However, a great deal of unexplained heterogeneity in facial feedback effects remains (I2 > 70), and current methods cannot address concerns about the impact of questionable research practices. Nevertheless, the available evidence supports the facial feedback hypothesis.","We conducted a meta-analysis of the facial feedback hypothesis literature.

However, less research investigated protective factors that may attenuate IPV among such men. Emotion regulation (i.e., awareness of emotions, ability to refrain from impulsive behavior, and access to emotion modulation strategies) gained attention as a protective trait for IPV. Prior research suggested that being able to regulate emotions well, even in the context of sex role violations, may preclude IPV. We investigated whether emotion regulation moderated the relationship between TSRE and psychological IPV among college men in southern Appalachia. We hypothesized that TSRE would positively associate with psychological IPV among men with poor emotion regulation skills. We collected cross-sectional, self-report data from 132 college men. The Traditional Egalitarian Sex Role scale assessed TSRE. Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale assessed emotion regulation. The Revised Conflict Tactics Scale assessed psychological IPV perpetration. Hierarchical regression analyses using the PROCESS macro for SPSS tested emotion regulation as a moderator of the relationship between TSRE and psychological IPV. The model was significant; the addition of the interaction term explained significant variance in psychological IPV scores, F(3,128) = 9.48, p < .001). Explication of the interaction indicated that TSRE positively related to psychological IPV among men with fewer (B = .58, p < .001), but not greater (B = .05, p = .77), emotion regulation skills. These preliminary results suggest that having adequate abilities to regulate affect may reduce men’s risk of psychological IPV, even in the context of high TSRE. Limitations will be discussed.","Prior research supported endorsement of traditional sex role expectations (e.g., that women should be homemakers) as a risk factor for intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration. Recent research supported emotion regulation as a set of skills that may protect against IPV; however, investigators have yet to determine whether greater emotion regulation skills mitigate the relationship between traditional sex role expectations and IPV among Southern men.

However, intensively-grazed dairy cattle spend more time foraging, which alters their time budget. Therefore, research examining their lying behavior is needed to offer recommendations for these systems. The objective was to quantify the lying behavior of grazing dairy cows under organic management. Lactating dairy cows (n = 230) from certified organic, grazing dairy farms (n = 5) were enrolled. Management systems were categorized based on housing system and feeding management. Low input (LI) systems (n = 3 farms; 171 cows) utilized a loose housing system and relied primarily on DMI from pasture, while high input (HI) systems (n = 2 farms; 59 cows) used tiestalls and the majority of DMI was received from concentrates and cut forages. Accelerometers were affixed to the cows’ rear leg for three 28-d periods during the spring (P1), summer (P2), and fall (P3) at the LI farms and during P1 and P3 at the HI farms. The data were analyzed using the MEANS procedure in SAS (v9.4) to quantify the mean daily and hourly lying time over sampling period and input system. Overall, cows on the HI farms laid longer in comparison to LI farms (11.16 ± 0.06 vs 8.49 ± 0.03 h/d). Lying time on both systems increased from P1 to P3 (P1/LI = 7.41 ± 0.07 h/d; P3/LI = 9.21 ± 0.05 h/d; P1/HI = 11.13 ± 0.08 h/d; P3/HI = 11.20 ± 0.09 h/d). The majority (72.6 ± 3.27%) of lying behavior on LI systems occurred at night from 19:00 – 7:00. Only 46.5 ± 2.1% of lying time took place at night on HI farms. These data suggest that cows in LI systems were more active and showed greater diurnal variations in comparison to cows fed primarily concentrates. Closer examination of the factors influencing variations in lying behavior among LI and HI systems will aid in formulating recommendations to maximize welfare and production on pasture dairies.","While the lying behavior of dairy cows is commonly used as a welfare measure in traditional, confinement systems, little is known about the activity of intensively-grazed dairy cows under organic management.

The objective was to compare the effects of no induced stressor (CONT), versus a single induced stressor; OS (7 fewer beds and feeding spaces than cows) or HS (no heat abatement) and 2 induced stressors (OS and HS, HSOS) on lactating dairy cattle welfare. A 4 x 4 Latin square was implemented on 64 cows (parity & DIM ± standard deviation; 1.7 ± 0.9 and 125.3 ± 60.8) from July to September 2017. Cows were equipped with accelerometers and housed in four similar pens containing sand bedded freestalls. Each period consisted of a 7 d acclimation and 7 d of data collection. Daily pen temperature humidity index (THI) was recorded. Respiration rate (RR) was recorded at 16:00 ± 1 h 4 x/weekly to determine pens’ heat load. Milk production was recorded 2x/d. Milk fat, protein, and somatic cell score (SCS; TN DHIA Lab) were collected once each period during AM and PM milking. The MIXED procedure (SAS 9.4, Cary NC) evaluated the effects of days in milk, parity, treatment, and THI on milk production, milk components, SCS, lying and standing time, and all 2-way interactions. Manual backwards elimination removed non-significant interactions, but main effects remained in the model, regardless of significance. Among HS and HSOS cows, RR averaged 64 and 65 breaths/min respectively, indicating mild HS. Heat stressed and HSOS cows produced 1.7 ± 0.8 and 2.2 ± 0.8 kg (P < 0.01) less milk than CONT and OS cows, but no difference in milk fat, protein, and SCS. Primiparous HSOS cows lay 85, 66, and 46 min/d less than CONT, OS, and HS cows, respectively (P < 0.05). Overstocked and HSOS cows took 187 and 198 more steps/d than CONT cows, respectively. Cows exposed to mild, short duration HS and OS decreased milk production and increased steps/d. This suggests that short duration HS, OS, and HSOS have negative effects on dairy cattle welfare.","Dairy producers are faced with 2 primary management challenges that can affect dairy cattle welfare: facility design and heat stress. Our objective is to determine the short-term impacts of a single induced environmental challenge versus multiple induced environmental challenges on dairy cattle welfare.

Multiparous Holstein cows (n=33) and nulliparous Holstein heifers (n=32) were dynamically enrolled -21 d prior to their expected calving date and removed on the day of calving. Cows had access to a bedded-pack barn (area 1; 13.94 m2), open pasture (area 2; 1.82 hectares), and an area of natural forage cover (i.e. trees and tall grasses; area 3; 0.24 hectares). Video data were used to determine calving location. Cows calved from August to December 2016. Season was categorized into summer (August 6th-September 21st), fall (September 22nd-December 20th) and winter (December 21st-December 28th). Stocking density was determined at calving. Mean daily stocking density was determined for each cow. Multinomial logistic regression (SAS 9.4) was used to test if factors were associated with the probability of calving in the three designated areas of the environment, and model selection was performed by backward manual elimination. Twenty-five calvings (38%) occurred in the barn, 17 calvings (26%) occurred on open pasture, and 23 calvings (35%) occurred in the area of natural forage cover. Parity was associated with the location of calving (P = 0.02). Comparing heifers to cows, heifers were more likely to calve in the natural forage area compared to the barn (OR = 5.88; 95% CI = 1.69, 20.42). However, there was no parity effect on the probability to calve in open pasture or the barn (OR = 2.89; 95% CI = 0.8, 10.53). Season, stocking density at calving, and mean daily stocking density was not associated with calving location preference (P > 0.25). These results suggest parity plays a role in preference for calving location when group housed. Calving areas that accommodate both heifers and cows’ environmental preferences for calving when grouped may improve calving outcomes.","Calving (the act of giving birth) is one of the most stressful events a dairy cow will experience during a production cycle.

Here, we use several Caenorhabditis species to ask what drives the decline of reproductive ability: use, time, or both? Naturally, Caenorhabditis species exist as male/female worms, yet a few species consist of males and hermaphroditic females. One study looked at reproduction after varying early progeny output in a hermaphroditic species, C. elegans. Results showed that late life progeny outcomes were similar and reproductive decline occurred at a similar rate regardless of early life reproduction. This points to an age-dependent mechanism. Another study measured the same concept of progeny output in C. brenneri. Results showed that brood size was larger in worms that had no early progeny compared to worms that made progeny their whole life. This shows early progeny production influences brood size, and that both age- and use- mechanisms are inherent to reproductive aging. Our study aims to ascertain the underlying mechanism by comparing two species, C. remanei to C. elegans. We compare late progeny production in two groups: one that makes progeny when young, and one that does not. We hypothesized that use does not accelerate reproductive aging, and that animals that do not reproduce early in life produce similar progeny counts late in life as animals that do reproduce early in life. The results from our experiment supported that there is no significant difference in progeny outcome between early- and late- mated groups. The ANOVA test compared both groups within each species and the p-values were over .05, illustrating that there was no detectable significant difference between early- and late-mated groups. The more we understand worm aging, the better hope we have for discovering remedies for human reproductive issues.","The study of reproductive aging in humans is no doubt a concern for scientists, but also for women hoping to maintain their capacity for reproduction.

Previous in vitro studies of three different dihydrofolate reductases as well as biophysical studies of folate find that osmolytes interact weakly with folate and dihydrofolate thereby replacing water in the hydration shell at certain functional groups. Removal of the osmolyte from the solvation shell of dihydrofolate is more difficult than removal of water, which weakens the binding. To determine if this phenomenon occurs in vivo, osmotic stress titrations of several folate pathway enzymes were performed in E. coli. Knockout and rescued strains of folate pathway enzymes were made in E. coli and subjected to osmotic stress. The bacterium synthesizes osmolytes in response to osmotic stress. Comparison of the growth of the knockout and rescued strains of the folate pathway enzymes would give us a measure of the effect of osmotic stress on the particular enzyme activity. We have found that the knockout strain could grow to high osmolalities on supplemented media while the rescued strain stopped growing at lower osmolalities on minimal media. From these osmotic stress titrations, we know that the in vivo enzyme activity can be titrated directly by osmotic stress and many factors in the cell can contribute to the activity being titrated. Therefore, we are studying the effects of osmolytes to an enzyme dihydropteroate synthase by Isothermal Titration Calorimetry which is an in vitro technique. Thus, by combining in vitro and in vivo studies, we will be able to answer if the activity of enzymes is affected by osmolytes and osmotic stress. This will help to bridge the gap between in vivo and in vitro studies with enzymes. ","Several advances have been made in identifying new drug molecules. However, one of the major bottlenecks is in understanding the effectiveness of compounds when tested within test tubes as compared to the human body. My research work is a small part towards understanding this and contributes towards bridging the gap between in-cell and in-test-tube studies. Research within my lab has identified that there are several small molecules in the cell that will either speed up or hinder the reactions. When experimenting in test-tubes, we fail to consider the effects of these small molecules on the action of the drug.

The chromosomes inside the nucleus, which are non-randomly organized into loops, domains and territories, must withstand this deformation. Here, we explore chromatin structure changes associated with migration-induced nuclear deformations. Heterochromatin protein 1α (HP1α), a protein associated with heterochromatin, has been implicated as a metastatic regulator and its lower expression correlates with a higher invasive phenotype leading to poor prognosis in breast cancer. However, the effect of this aberrant HP1α expression on the 3D genome structure is not fully understood. We present immunofluorescence data which suggest that invasive breast cancer cells employ smaller HP1α clusters. Correspondingly, HP1α overexpression both results in bigger clusters tethered to the nuclear periphery and inhibits migration through tight spaces. Additionally, live cell imaging data indicate a dynamic reorganization of the 3D genome of breast cancer cells when migrating through tight constrictions. These observations have inspired the hypothesis that HP1α and other chromatin modifiers might regulate invasion through a dynamic interplay of structural and genetic changes that enhance breast cancer cell metastasis. We have employed chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) and chromatin accessibility (ATAC-Seq) assays that will further clarify the relationship between medically relevant nuclear deformation, chromatin state changes, and 3D genome organization.","Metastasis, the ability of cancer cells to spread from the localized tumor to surrounding tissues, is the deadliest part of cancer. During metastasis, cancer cells are often faced with small constrictions from tissue junctions and extracellular matrix that causes the cells to squeeze and deform their nucleus, which stores the chromosomes and genetic information of the cell. Our research is examining the changes that take place in the organization of the chromosomes inside the nucleus when a cancer cell needs to squeeze and determine if these changes contribute to or are a result of metastasis.

Although changes in translational efficiency have been well documented at the level of mRNA-ribosome loading, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. The reversible phosphorylation of RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN OF THE SMALL SUBUNIT 6 (RPS6) has been known for 40 years, but the biochemical significance of this event remains unclear to this day. Here, we confirm using a clock-deficient strain of Arabidopsis thaliana that RPS6 phosphorylation (RPS6-P) is controlled by the diel light-dark cycle with a peak during the day. Strikingly, when wild-type, clock-enabled, seedlings that have been entrained to a light-dark cycle are placed under free-running conditions, the circadian clock drives a cycle of RPS6-P with an opposite phase, peaking during the subjective night. We show that in wild-type seedlings under a light-dark cycle, the incoherent light and clock signals are integrated by the plant to cause an oscillation in RPS6-P with a reduced amplitude with a peak during the day. Sucrose can stimulate RPS6-P, as seen when sucrose in the medium masks the light response of etiolated seedlings. These data exemplify a striking case of contrasting biochemical regulation between clock signals and light signals. Although the physiological significance of RPS6-P remains unknown, our data provide a mechanistic basis for the future understanding of this enigmatic event.","Proteins are synthesized in the cell by large complex molecules known as ribosomes.

The active site of this enzyme is located at the dimer interface. Two thermostable variants for this enzyme show only single amino acid changes in their primary amino acid sequences (T130K, D80Y). The D80Y has a higher melting temperature compared to the T130K. Our studies indicate that the T130K mimics the WT enzyme in terms of dynamics and enzyme-ligand thermodynamics while the D80Y exhibits different behaviors. This led us to hypothesize that T130K is just a thermostable version of the mesophilic WT exhibiting the same behaviors while the D80Y is the true thermophilic variant with distinct properties. We show that the thermodynamic parameters of the binary enzyme–aminoglycoside complexes of these variants show highly significant differences also in the presence of different solvents. The data, acquired in H2O and D2O in this work by isothermal titration calorimetry demonstrate that solvent reorganization upon ligand binding show large differences between the two variants. The heat capacity change (ΔCp) also show antibiotic-dependent differences between the two variants. Our X-ray structures show that the aminoglycoside neomycin is positioned properly at the active site of T130K while in the case of D80Y the tyrosine substitution disrupts the binding site of the ligand. This structural difference explains why we observe differences in the thermodynamics of the ligand binding properties between these variants. Furthermore, temperature affects the monomer-dimer equilibrium of these enzymes differently. Thus, our work suggest that thermodynamics of ligand-protein interactions, solvent effects and monomer-dimer equilibrium may be among the molecular parameters that separate thermophilic proteins from simply those that are thermostable but otherwise identical to the mesophilic counterparts.",Thermostable enzymes are enzymes that are able to catalyze particular chemical reactions even at elevated temperatures. This makes them very valuable mainly for industrial purposes. Our research aims to identify the molecular features that create an thermostable enzyme.

In bacteria, genetic tractability plays a key role in the research tools available for modifying strains and gaining a deeper understanding of certain traits of interest. Streptococcus thermophilus is one bacterium responsible for industrial yogurt production, making it extremely economically important. Several strains of S. thermophilus have adapted to the milk and yogurt environments through the acquisition of specific genes which produce exopolysaccharides. Within most production facilities, only a few species of bacteria are needed, and these monocultures are vulnerable to infection by bacterial viruses, or bacteriophages. S. thermophilus deals with infections through a few defense systems, including the celebrated CRISPR/Cas adaptive immune systems and restriction-modification (R-M) systems, which work in tandem to protect the cells from bacteriophages. Unfortunately, R-M systems also protect the cells from researchers inputting new DNA into the cells through plasmids, a common form of genetic manipulation. We investigated the evolution of defense systems within several S. thermophilus strains through phylogenetics.

It has been used as soil amendment for thousands of years; however, its benefits vary depending on feedstock type, amount applied to the field and time since application. To determine the effects of biochar amendment on soil properties and plant growth in the cropping systems of Tennessee, we started a field experiment in Lebanon, TN. Soil in site is Bradyville (fine, mixed, semiactive, thermic Typic Hapludalfs). We surface applied different rates of biochar on tall fescue dominated pasture in April 2017. The six treatments were an untreated control treatment (0 Mg/ha) and five biochar treatments (4.5, 9, 13.5, 18, and 22.5 Mg/ha) with 4 replications per treatment. The biochar used in this study was prepared by mixing 97% hardwood woodchips (mainly Populus spp.) and 3% biosolids. To evaluate the effect of time since biochar application on soil properties, we plan to collect and analyze soil samples every 6 months. The first soil sampling was conducted in June 2017 from 0-15 cm depth along with the harvest of fescue plants and the second soil sampling was in December 2017. We determined plant yield and plant nutrient status as well as soil properties such as soil pH, gravimetric moisture content, soil organic carbon, microbial biomass, total soil nitrogen, inorganic nitrogen and extractable phosphorus and potassium. The results showed increased potassium in plants with 22.5 Mg/ha as compared to the control. None of the soil properties were significantly different across the treatments except soil ammonium-N, which decreased significantly with increased biochar application rate in the first sampling. In the second sampling, ammonium-N showed similar trend, but the mean values were not statistically different.

There are number of studies that reported the effect of temperature on soil microbial respiration but very less has been done on studying the moisture sensitivity to the carbon dynamics and microbial activities in different textured soils. The aim of the present study was (i) to examine the effects of modified soil moisture conditions and different soil textures on soil carbon dynamics and (ii) to describe the dependence of soil microbial activities on soil moisture status in different soil particle sizes. Soil samples of three distinct textures: sandy, loamy and clayey were collected during late summer of 2017 from Georgia, Missouri and Tennessee, respectively. All soil samples were collected from mixed forests. Moisture manipulations were made based on combination of 5 moisture levels; air dried, 25% water holding capacity (WHC), 50% WHC, 100% WHC and 100% water filled pore space. Soils were pre-incubated and then incubated in mason jars for a period of 90 days and soil respiration (Rh) was measured from these microcosms on a weekly basis. Destructive sampling was conducted at different time points to determine the microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, dissolved organic carbon, hydrolytic and oxidative enzyme activities to detect their potential contributions to the moisture induced microbial respiration variation in the microcosm. Results show carbon dioxide respiration was comparatively higher in loamy soils than the sandy soils. In sandy soils, T3 (50% WHC) showed highest respiration while in loamy soils, T4 (WHC) showed highest respiration. Methane concentration was comparatively higher in sandy soils than the loamy soils. This study gives us an insight as to which moisture status is contributing to the most greenhouse gas emission in soils and is conducive for the microbial population in soils. ",Soil respiration contributes 60-80% of the total ecosystem respiration and soil texture and moisture are one of the most important factors that influence the soil respiration. So studying an interaction between these two abiotic factors would give us an insight to how these factors impact soil respiration and in turn the global carbon cycle.

Potentially, minerals can sequester hazardous elements, e.g. radionuclides or other toxic trace elements, during precipitation. The link between incorporation of impurities and their effect on growth rates and mineral morphology is not well understood. Recent process-based crystal growth models have suggested two possibilities for the mechanism by which inhibitors poison growth: (1) solubility changes as a results of impurity incorporation and (2) blocking of the attachment of the constituent ions. Here, we used the model system of barite (BaSO4) and strontium to elucidate the growth mechanism. Barite is a ubiquitous, sparingly-soluble mineral that is known for the incorporation of toxic trace elements, as e.g. radium, lead or strontium-90.

These factors should be prioritized for control and preventive efforts aimed at improving cardiovascular health in Florida. ","Cardiovascular diseases, such as Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI) or heart attack, are the leading cause of preventable premature deaths for men and women in FL, accounting for 1 in every 3 fatalities in the state. A growing body of evidence indicates that several area-level factors, known as socioeconomic determinants of health, can affect the types of exposures or health care access that one experiences, and impact the risk and burden of MI in some communities. Therefore, dealing with the social determinants of health offers the greatest opportunities for reducing deaths from MI in FL. This study identified county-level demographic and socioeconomic determinants of MI-related hospitalizations occurring in the state of FL over a period of 10 years."
I-House Community Room,10:20 - 10:40,10:20,Kathryn Purple,Purple,,Comparative and Experimental Medicine,Decreased dissolved oxygen as a possible mechanism of increased persistence of Trichomonas gallinae in the presence of organic material in water,"The transmission of Trichomonas gallinae, an avian protozoan parasite, from infected to naïve hosts may be facilitated by backyard birdbaths of varying cleanliness. T. gallinae persists longer, up to 20 hours, in distilled water when organic material (OM) is added to mimic soiled birdbaths. Of the many factors that OM can alter in water, including pH, nutrient availability, and presence of environmental microbes, we hypothesized that the decrease in dissolved oxygen (DO) created by aerobic decomposition could be a key factor leading to increased persistence of this microaerophilic trichomonad. Through a series of experiments using plastic containers to simulate birdbaths, we determined 1) the levels of DO in distilled water created by the addition of various amounts of OM, 2) the amount of the enzyme Oxyrase needed to re-create those oxygen levels, and finally, 3) the persistence of two T. gallinae isolates in distilled water with artificially lowered DO. Oxyrase was added to 500ml distilled water in three treatment concentrations: 0%, 0.5% and 1%, which created DO levels of approximately 8-9ppm, 1-2ppm and 0-1ppm, respectively. The latter concentrations of DO were representative of those created with the addition of OM. We evaluated one trichomonad isolate cultured from a Cooper’s hawk (Accipiter cooperii) and one from a broad-winged hawk (Buteo platypterus) by adding ~1 million trichomonads to 500ml distilled water in our birdbaths in triplicate. Aliquots of 0.5ml taken at various time points from the birdbaths were inoculated into Hollander Fluid media, incubated at 37°C, and read by light microscopy every other day for 5 days. Both isolates persisted up to 18 and 30hrs in the 0.5% and 1% Oxyrase treatments respectively. In contrast, in unaltered distilled water, neither the COHA nor the BWHA isolate persisted past 4hrs. These results offer a possible method to deter trichomonads’ persistence by keeping birdbaths clean and free of debris.","Trichomonas gallinae is an avian protozoan parasite that causes necrosis in the oral cavity of affected birds, often resulting in death in some host species, and can have substantial negative impacts on the populations level. Trichomonads are not hardy in the environment, but can persist in water for up to 30 hours in different conditions, validating bird baths as potential sources of infection for naive birds. We examined if decreased dissolved oxygen in water, resulting from the addition of organic material, could increase the persistence of T. gallinae in simulated bird baths so that we could suggest methods to prevent spread of this pathogen (e.g. keeping bird baths free of organic debris)."

A general expression for saltation threshold is needed to predict threshold speeds on Earth and on other planetary bodies where aeolian activity is present. Threshold is a function of the density ratio, the ratio of the density of the sediment being entrained to the density of the fluid (or wind) entraining the sediment. Previous work resulted in an expression for the dimensionless threshold parameter, A, as a function of the density ratio [Iversen et al. 1987]. This expression was based on data from experiments in water, high-density air, and low-density air, which gave density ratios that cover five orders of magnitude. Data from the Venus Wind Tunnel, filtered to include only data for grain sizes greater than 200 µm and particle Reynolds numbers greater than 10, constrain the central portion of the curve. However, this transitional portion of the curve, between low (<10) and high (>1000) density ratios, does not fit recent threshold data from the Titan Wind Tunnel (TWT) subject to the same filtering conditions. We investigated the validity of the density ratio term and its inclusion in the Iversen et al. threshold model. This investigation entailed running new threshold experiments in the TWT under a range of density ratios conditions. We derived a new expression for the density ratio curve to fit the previous and newly collected TWT threshold data. This new expression increases the value of A in the transitional portion of the curve. This result is consistent with the use of previous TWT threshold data that were found to be higher than predicted [Burr et al., 2015] by the Iversen et al. model. This new threshold curve will increase the accuracy of predicting saltation threshold friction speeds, improving planetary models and terrestrial ones as well.","Threshold wind speed is the minimum wind speed required to lift sediment off the ground so that it can be transported by the wind. It is important to know this speed as it provides researchers with clues about how the surface and the atmosphere interact with one another. I research threshold wind speeds on Saturn’s moon, Titan, by simulating Titan’s atmosphere in a wind tunnel and blowing sand inside the tunnel. I use the results of this work to create a model that predicts threshold wind speeds on Titan and other planetary bodies. "

The Geographic Information System (GIS) models developed in this study will help SMART City Challenge winner, Columbus to examine sustainable freight transportation options to reduce energy usage. This study primarily focuses on last-mile delivery scenarios and estimates energy savings using new technologies versus using standard UPS diesel trucks. UPS provided Global Positioning System (GPS) data from their Columbus Depot truck fleet, and MORPC provided Traffic Analysis Zone (TAZ)-level socioeconomic, business, and land use data. Using these datasets along with locational variables developed in ArcGIS software, a model was developed to estimate freight deliveries throughout Columbus. This model can be used in other cities or regions to estimate freight delivery demand when GPS data is lacking. TransCAD GIS software was used to develop optimized truck routes using actual UPS GPS data and estimates from the model. The routes were compared with alternative optimized multi-modal delivery scenarios to determine energy savings for last-mile deliveries. Electric Vehicle (EV) trucks, EV delivery vans, parcel lockers, drones, and Uber-style delivery systems were considered. Recommendations were provided based on initial findings from the model.","Freight network modeling is crucial to better understanding ways to improve efficiency and reduce the energy impact of freight transport.

While most blueberries grow strictly on acidic soils, the wild V. arboreum (sparkleberry) tolerates a soil pH up to 6.5. Evolution of blueberries has produced plants with different levels of ploidy, ranging from diploid to hexaploid. One of the most commonly cultivated species is tetraploid V. corymbosum, which contains 4X=2n=48 chromosomes with an estimated size of 600 Mb/haploid genome. A reference genome with annotations was developed from diploid V. corymbosum. In the present study, RNA-Seq data was used for (i) comparison of multiple strategies to improve mapping of reads across Vaccinium species to the V. corymbosum reference and (ii) analysis of differential gene expression in plants from tetraploid V. corymbosum and diploid V. arboreum grown at control pH 4.5 and challenging pH 6.5. Our results using different mapping software revealed an impairment between mapping rate and conversion to gene counts. Estimation of differential expression using quasi-likelihood F test yielded 337 and 4,867 genes in V. corymbosum and V. arboreum, respectively, responding to pH treatment. Both species shared regulation of genes involved in nutrient homeostasis and lignin metabolism. V. arboreum exhibited regulation of signaling pathways related to abiotic/biotic stress, cellulose and lignin biosynthesis, and nutrient uptake, while V. corymbosum did not. These responses likely enable V. arboreum to tolerate higher soil pH. Lack of differential expression of these pathways in V. corymbosum might be related to this species’ strict soil adaptation.","Blueberries are highly nutritious fruits but growth of their plants requires acidic soils that require maintenance.

The relative importance of ash chemistry and site biogeochemistry in ranking coal ash contaminant leaching potential","Every year in the United States, over 100 million tons of coal ash waste is produced as a byproduct of electricity generation. Coal ash can present an ecological risk if toxic elements in the ash, such as arsenic, selenium, and mercury, are mobilized during disposal and transformed into bioavailable species. The chemical composition of coal ash is highly heterogeneous and dependent on the origin of the source coal, combustion parameters, and type and configuration of air pollution control devices. This heterogeneity results in uncertainty in the evaluation of leaching potential of contaminants from coal ash. The goal of this work was to identify whether a single leaching protocol could roughly group high-leaching potential coal ash from low-leaching potential coal ash, with respect to arsenic and selenium. We used four different leaching tests, including the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Protocol, natural pH, aerobic sediment microcosms, and anaerobic sediment microcosms on 10 different coal ash materials, including fly ash, lime-treated ash, and flue gas desulfurization materials. Leaching tests showed promise in categorizing high and low-leaching potential ash materials, indicating that a single point test could act as a first screening measure to identify high-risk ash materials. However, the amount of contaminant leached varied widely across tests, reflecting the importance of ambient conditions (pH, redox state) on leaching. These results demonstrate that on-site geochemical conditions play a critical role in arsenic and selenium mobilization from coal ash, underscoring the need to develop a situation-based risk assessment framework for contamination by coal ash pollutants.","Coal ash is a byproduct of electricity generation that is enriched in toxic trace elements, including arsenic, selenium, and mercury, which present an ecological risk if leached during coal ash disposal. Our research explores the factors that control ash contaminant leaching.

Currently, the cellulosic biofuel industry relies on a conventional system where feedstock is harvested, baled, stored locally and then delivered in a low-density format to the biorefinery. However, the conventional supply chain system causes operational disruptions at the biorefinery mainly due to seasonal availability, handling problems, and quality variability in biomass feedstock. Operational disruptions decrease facility uptime, production efficiencies, and increase maintenance costs. In bioenergy industry, for a low-value high-volume product where margins are very tight, system disruptions are especially problematic. In this work we evaluate advanced system strategy in which a network of biomass processing centers (depots) are utilized for storing and preprocessing biomass into stable, dense, and uniform material to reduce feedstock supply disruptions, facility downtime, and thus boost economic returns to the bioenergy industry. A database centric discrete event supply chain simulation model was developed and the impact of operational disruptions on supply chain cost, inventory and production levels, and uptime, downtime, ramp up time, starved time for the operations were evaluated. The variation in uptime at the depot and biorefinery directly affects the processing operations at both entities and thus impacts the reliability of biomass supply chain system. ",Lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks are promising and sustainable alternative replacements for petroleum-based fuels and chemicals. Operational disruptions at biorefineries due to inconsistent biomass supply and quality is one of the major challenges for commercialization of this system. We evaluate an alternative strategy where biomass is pre-processed at depots into a uniform format and then transported to the biorefinery to reduce operational disruptions and increase throughput.

Pantoea sp. YR343 is a plant-associated Gram-negative gamma-proteobacteria that produces carotenoids. We recently reported a carotenoid mutant which not only showed reduced antioxidant potential but also displayed unexpected defects in biofilm formation, secretion of indole-3-acetic acid, and root colonization compared to wildtype cells. In silico molecular simulations suggest that carotenoids can act as modulators of membrane biophysical properties by controlling fluidity of membranes. We hypothesize that carotenoids modulate membrane dynamics by influencing the composition and organization of membrane proteins and lipids, leading to efficient signaling and transport. Fluorescence Anisotropy measurements on vesicles generated from lipids extracted from either wild type or mutant cells revealed that the wildtype membrane vesicles were significantly more rigid than mutant membrane vesicles. In contrast, anisotropy measurements on whole cells indicated that wildtype cells were less rigid than mutant cells. These observations were confirmed by atomic force microscopy. Mass spectrometric based analysis of membrane proteins and lipids revealed differences in membrane protein and lipid profiles between the mutant and wildtype cells. Among the different classes of proteins, signaling and transport protein classes were the most effected in the mutant. Similarly, unsaturated and cyclopropane fatty acids classes differed in both cell types. In conclusion, loss of carotenoids in cell membranes changes the abundance and distribution of membrane proteins and lipids which may be the result of, or help compensate for, changes in membrane biophysical properties. ","Carotenoids are colored pigments found everywhere in nature. The most extensively investigated functions of carotenoids are its role in photosynthesis and as an potent antioxidant. In bacteria, carotenoids play bigger roles in membranes, where they can act as an thermal stabilizing agent which is very important for micro-organisms to adapt to changing environments.

Empirical support of behavioral complexity is needed for predictive modeling/theory development. Experts suggest that EMA of self-reported exercise behavior should also include an objective measure. Our purpose was to use accelerometry to validate self-reported ambulatory exercise bouts (walking and running) reported during EMA of exercise behavior and its antecedents. Across 14-d, participants (N=29, 55% female, 24+/-6y) completed four momentary surveys/d while wearing an accelerometer (30 Hz) on the hip during all waking hours. For each report of exercise, participants indicated type (walking, swimming, resistance training) and duration. Raw data were converted to counts/10-s. A programmed approach was developed to detect ambulatory bouts. The Crouter 2-Regression Model was applied to distinguish continuous ambulation from other activity and MATLAB code was written to report the date, time, and intensity of each bout. These results were compared to time-stamped survey data to determine the validity of self-reported bouts. Of 122 self-reported bouts, 92 were verified by visually assessing accelerometer data. The programmed approach detected 38 bouts, which underestimated duration (6.6+/-13.0 min) and intensity (2.5+/-1.4%). Intermittent bouts (54) were not captured by the programmed approach. Most self-reported bouts were validated by visual assessment of accelerometer data. It may be reasonable to expect a similar degree of reporting accuracy for non-ambulatory bouts.

PURPOSE: To determine the accuracy and compare step counts between D and ND wrist-worn devices, under free-living conditions for all waking hours. METHODS: Twelve participants (mean±SD, 35±13 yr) wore an ActiGraph GT9X and Fitbit Charge (FC) on the D and ND wrists. A GoPro was pointed at the feet to video record steps taken in a day. Hand-counted steps served as a criterion and used to calculate percent of hand-counted steps. Raw AG data was processed with the ActiLife step counting algorithm, with and without low frequency extension (AGLFE and AG, respectively) and the Moving Average Vector Magnitude algorithm (AGM). For each step counting method, a repeated measured ANOVA was used to compare the step counts from the D wrist vs. ND wrist. RESULTS: There was no significant device x wrist interaction. On average, the devices on the D wrist recorded 1,253 steps more than those on the ND wrist. Percent of hand-counted steps for D devices reported: FC-84%, AG-122%, AGLFE-220%, AGM-91% and for ND devices: FC-77%, AG-109%, AGLFE-196%, AGM-84%. Across all methods, there was a significant difference step per day between D and ND wrist (F(1,11)=11.81, p=.006). CONCLUSION: Users of activity monitors should be aware of the differences in steps per day between D and ND wrists. ","With the increased popularity of step counting, many manufacturers of fitness wearables allow the user to choose to wear the device on the dominant or non-dominant wrist.

DLCs are extremely resistant to environmental degradation and metabolism and accumulate in fatty tissues of animals biomagnifying along the food chain towards human consumption. Exposure to DLCs has been linked to numerous diseases and adverse health effects, such as endocrine system disruption, reproductive and developmental deficiencies, neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity, and metabolic diseases. An autonomously bioluminescent Saccharomyces cerevisiae BLYAhS bioreporter was developed for simple and rapid detection of DLCs and other aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonists. This recombinant yeast reporter was based on a synthetic bacterial luciferase reporter gene cassette (lux) that can produce luciferase and the enzymes capable of self-synthesizing the requisite substrates for bioluminescence from endogenous cellular metabolites. As a result, bioluminescent signal production is generated continuously and autonomously. The BLYAhS bioreporter emitted bioluminescent signal in a dose-responsive manner to DLC exposure. The model dioxin, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), could be detected within 4 hours with a half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of ~ 8.1 nM and lower detection limit of 500 pM using a 96-well plate assay format.

As shrinking glaciers become cut off from fjords, the direct conduit of terrestrially derived material is removed. Reduction in fjord sediment delivery may upset biogeochemical cycling, ultimately altering the ecosystem balance of sediment microbial communities. Here, we investigate microbial community structure and interactions within sediments adjacent to a tidewater glacier in Van Keulenfjorden, Svalbard (79°N). Devonian iron-rich bedrock surrounding the glacier supplies significant amounts of iron to the fjord with seasonal glacial runoff. In these anoxic sediments, sulfate does not decrease with depth, despite active sulfate reduction, indicating that chemical and biological factors may facilitate the oxidation of sulfide. We hypothesized tight coupling between iron oxidizers and sulfate reducers that are engaged in microbially-mediated cryptic sulfur cycling. We extracted DNA from 1 cm intervals down to 20 cm depth and generated 16S rRNA gene libraries. The change in relative abundance of key taxa with depth was evaluated with respect to distance from the glacier and with organic geochemistry measurements. Desulfuromonadales, which include iron reducers, were more prevalent in sediments closest to the glacier. The majority of sulfate reducing sequences were from the genus Desulfobulbus, which peak in deeper sediment layers alongside the sulfur disproportionating Desulfocapsa. Microbial network analysis showed the iron-reducing Geobacteraceae co-occur with sulfate reducers. Nitrosomonadales, containing iron oxidizers, have negative relationships with both sulfate reducing and iron reducing taxa. These observations coupled to porewater geochemistry help us interpret how key microorganisms shape their geochemical environment and mediate transformations of sulfur species.","Microorganisms play important roles in the break down of organic matter in the environment.

This involves changes in carbon and nitrogen concentrations and increased microbial and entomological activity. In addition to decomposing tissues, vertebrates contain their own microbes on the skin and in the gut. As a vertebrate decomposes, these microbes are released into surrounding environment. In a previous study, we found that during human decomposition, human-associated microbes are detectable in the soil, and some, such as Bacteroides, persist for long periods of time. The majority of human decomposition studies focus on surface decomposition, and effects of decomposing vertebrates in subsurface systems is not as well understood. The goal of this study was to assess the presence of human-associated microbes in a subsurface vertebrate decomposition system. Three deceased human subjects were interred in a grave at University of Tennessee Anthropological Research Facility in February 2013. The grave remained undisturbed for four years until March 2017 when remains were exhumed. Soils were collected from lateral transects radiating from the grave at two depths (0-5 cm and 30-35 cm), and within the grave at depths of 0-5 cm, 30-35 cm, 70-75 cm, and 80-85 cm. Soil samples were analyzed for abundances of human-specific Bacteroides via qPCR. Decomposition resulted in significant changes within the grave. The base of the grave (70-75 cm) was saturated (i.e. anoxic), however elevated respiration rates, enrichment of bacteria-feeding nematodes and enhanced extracellular enzyme potentials demonstrated an active microbial community. In addition, human-specific Bacteroides were only found in samples from the base of the grave, where the anaerobic conditions likely allowed for persistence of these obligate anaerobes. This provides some insight into soil markers that could guide recovery, discovery, and/or age of a gravesite.","Decomposition of vertebrates in terrestrial ecosystems transforms the surrounding environment, altering soil physiochemistry and microbial ecology. The majority of human decomposition studies focus on surface decomposition, and effects of decomposing vertebrates in subsurface systems is not as well understood. The goal of our work was to assess the presence of human-associated microbes in a subsurface vertebrate decomposition system."

The commercial information technology (IT) cybersecurity methods are not applicable to ICS directly because there are lots of difference between them. For example, the bandwidth of ICS is much narrower than it is in IT, which makes port-scanning tools not possible in ICS. Additionally, most current intrusion detection techniques are network-only based, which maybe not sufficient for low bandwidth ICS. This research proposes a feasible ICS intrusion detection method by integrating the network traffic data, computer system data, and industry process data into empirical models, which may provide a larger coverage of detectable cyberattacks. To generate the data needed for testing this proposed method, a real-time ICS test bed was built at the University of Tennessee. It contains a physical flow loop which simulates the thermal-hydraulic part of a typical two-loop nuclear power system; a LabVIEW-based supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system, which receives the sensor data from and sends commands to the flow loop; and a local area network (LAN), which enables cyberattack simulation. The flow loop contains an adjustable 9 kw heater that simulates normal operational transients. There are two PI controllers in LabVIEW which control the heater inlet and outlet temperature at their set points by sending commands to flow controllers (a variable speed pump and a motor operated valve) in the flow loop. Several intrusions within LAN, such as data tampering, were conducted to simulate system operation. Empirical models and machine learning algorithms will be applied to the network and process data to build an intrusion detection framework.","Due to the growth in the number and ability of industrial control system (ICS) targeted cyberattacks, cybersecurity of ICS urgently needs to be strengthened.

Strong 611,2:40 - 3:00,14:40,Sujana Chandrasekar,Chandrasekar,,Nuclear Engineering,Detecting process anomalies in additive manufacturing using data,"Additive Manufacturing (AM) is an exciting new technology that promises to revolutionize the world of manufacturing today. Additive Manufacturing or 3D printing, by definition, refers to the process of creating shapes layer by layer. Because of this bottom up approach, most manufacturability constraints associated with subtractive manufacturing processes are eliminated in AM methods. Also, AM opens up the possibility of printing new alloys which may have been difficult to process using conventional manufacturing methods. A key challenge with AM parts lies in understanding properties of a “printed” part. Since AM creates parts layerwise, it is possible to have local variation in properties that are significant enough to affect macro level behavior under load. Understanding and quantifying layer characteristics across thousands of layers is thus necessary to qualify a part for commercial use. This is a daunting task but one that may be made possible by the use of data analytic methods. Our research involves use of pattern recognition methods to process layerwise data generated during AM. The aim is to enable fast and efficient search for anomalies in data that may indicate unintentional changes in the AM process. Once potential anomalies have been detected using data, the part quality certification step involves looking at only anomalous layers and not the entire part. Anomaly detection in a time series data is closely related to similarity search. Our research involves adapting symbolic structural similarity methods to time series data generated during the AM process to quantify underlying similarity between layers being printed. This leads to identification of possible anomalies. Our work shows that it is possible to use symbolic methods of similarity search for irregularly sampled data under specific assumptions. Current work involves discovery of anomalies in regular shapes printed by AM. Future work includes extending anomaly detection to irregular shapes.","Additive Manufacturing (AM) or 3D printing holds tremendous promise as it makes it possible to manufacture or ""print"" complex shapes that were considered impossible using conventional manufacturing methods. However, one of the key challenges of AM parts is that they have local variation in properties due to the AM process and thus are difficult to certify for commercial use. Our research looks at applying pattern recognition methods to examine data from AM processes and thereby locate regions which may be potentially defective or need attention during part qualification."
Baker 329,9:00 - 9:20,09:00,Rebecca Wiener,Wiener,,Psychology,Infant perceptual-motor exploration of objects with varying perceptual properties,"From birth, infants are tasked with learning how to integrate perceived properties of the environment, which they accomplish via perceptual-motor exploration. Research shows that by about 9 months, infants begin incorporating such information into their action plans; specifically, they can discover non-obvious properties of objects by manipulating them and use such information to plan future object interactions. However, thus far this has only been studied with objects presented in isolation. The current study investigated whether infants, when presented with two objects, could discover a non-obvious property of one object via perceptual-motor exploration. Additionally, we explored whether such discovery could be generalized to novel objects. Seventeen infants, aged 11 months, were presented with two objects: first out of reach to measure gaze via eye-tracking and then within reach to allow manipulation up to 10 trials. The objects’ obvious features only differed in color, but one object was filled with rice so that it made noise and felt different when shaken. Then, infants were presented with 3 novel-shaped objects with the same perceptual properties for 6 additional trials. Looking and manipulation behaviors were analyzed, including the first object fixation, accumulated object looking durations, the first object contacted, overall durations of contact with each object, and durations of shaking. Comparisons between objects averaged across the first 10 trials revealed no overall differences, except that infants shook the filled object more than the unfilled one (p<.002). Subsequent comparisons showed that for the generalization trials, infants both shook the filled object more (p<.001) and contacted it more overall (p<.010). These results indicate that, when presented with two objects, 11-month-olds can selectively discover a non-obvious perceptual property of an object via perceptual-motor exploration and can generalize this discovery to novel-shaped objects.","Infants explore their surroundings and use perceptual-motor feedback to learn about their environment's properties. This research investigated how discovery of various perceptual properties of  two objects and perceptual-motor feedback informed infants' subsequent exploration of the objects in 11-month-olds. Specifically, the study looked at visual and manual exploratory behaviors over the course of 10 trials of object presentation using eye-tracking and video coding."

Choline is an essential dietary nutrient that is an integral component of all cell membranes and is also a precursor to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. As such, we are currently investigating the potential brain regions impacted by dietary choline to protect against the effects of prenatal stress. One potential brain region, the nucleus accumbens, plays a role in depression and anxiety-related behaviors. Alpha4 beta2 receptors are located in the nucleus accumbens, however, whether prenatal stress or choline impacts receptor levels is unknown. We hypothesized that prenatal stress will decrease whereas choline will increase levels of alpha4 beta2 receptors in the nucleus accumbens. Pregnant dams were stressed (or left undisturbed) during their last week of gestation (gestational days 14-21). The offspring were weaned at postnatal day 21 and assigned to same-sex, cage mates. Once the rodents reached adulthood, offspring brains were collected and processed for quantitative autoradiography using an I125 epibatidine (alpha4 beta2 nAChR-selective) ligand. We are currently analyzing the data and the results will be presented at XYZ","Our lab previously demonstrated that prenatal stress induces anxiety related behavioral changes in rodents, and that the administration of choline, a natural supplement that has been shown to reduce the  during pregnancy mitigated those negative effects. Now that we know what behaviors are being affected by prenatal stress, we are looking into what effects stress and choline supplementation have on the brain. "

Syrian hamsters are highly aggressive and territorial, but after social defeat they exhibit a conditioned defeat (CD) response which is characterized by increased submissive behavior and a failure to defend their home territory against a smaller, non-aggressive intruder. Hamsters with dominant social status show increased c-Fos expression in the infralimbic (IL) and prelimbic (PL) cortices following defeat and display a reduced CD response at testing compared to subordinates and controls. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that dominant hamsters would show increased defeat-induced neural activity in IL, but not PL, neurons that send projections to the basolateral amygdala (BLA) compared to subordinates.  We paired male Syrian hamsters in daily social encounters during which they formed stable dominance relationships. Animals also underwent stereotaxic surgery and cholera toxin B (CTB) was injected into the BLA. After the last dominance encounter, dominant, subordinate, and social status control hamsters received acute social defeat. Sixty minutes after defeat or control procedures, animals were euthanized and brains collected for CTB and c-Fos dual immunohistochemistry. We found that dominants display greater c-Fos+ cells in both the IL and PL. Also, dominants display a significantly greater proportion of double labeled c-Fos+CTB cells in both the IL and PL. These findings suggest that dominant hamsters activate vmPFC projections to the BLA following social defeat, which may be responsible for their reduced CD response. This project extends our understanding of the neural circuits underlying stress resistance which is an important step towards identifying novel targets for the prevention and treatment of stress-related psychopathology.","Stress is a contributing factor in the etiology of several mood and anxiety disorders, but not everyone that experiences a stressful event develops stress-related psychopathology. Resilience refers to the ability to maintain normal levels of psychological, biological, and social functioning following a trauma or stressful event.

This presentation will describe the projections from the prefrontal cortex to the amygdala that are associated with stress resilience in Syrian hamsters that achieve dominant social status."
Baker 329,10:40 - 11:00,10:40,Kimberly Bress,Bress,,Psychology,Effects of social dominance on defeat-induced neural activity in a ventral hippocampus-to-basolateral amygdala circuit,"Interactions between the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA) play a critical role in the processing of emotional memories. While these brain regions are implicated in the development of stress-related mental illness, the role of a vHPC-to-BLA neural circuit in susceptibility to the effects of stress is not well understood. After exposure to acute social defeat stress, male Syrian hamsters exhibit a submissive behavioral response called conditioned defeat (CD). Importantly, hamsters with subordinate social status display an elevated CD response compared to dominants and controls. In this study, adult male Syrian hamsters were paired in daily agonistic encounters for 14 days, during which they formed stable dominance relationships. On day 9, stereotaxic surgery was performed and cholera toxin B (CTB) was injected into the BLA. After a 48-hour recovery period, animals completed days 10-14 of their dominance interactions. 24 hours after the last dominance encounter, dominant, subordinate, and social status control animals were exposed to acute social defeat stress, consisting of three 5-min defeats at 5-min intervals. 60 minutes after the third defeat, hamsters were transcardially perfused and brains were collected for CTB and c-Fos immunohistochemistry. We found that exposure to social defeat did not alter the number of c-Fos positive cells in the vHPC, and that there was no effect of dominance status. Additionally, exposure to social defeat did not affect the number of c-Fos/CTB double-labeled neurons in the vHC. There were no status dependent differences in c-Fos/CTB double labeling. These results suggest that repeated aggressive encounters do not affect stress-induced c-Fos expression in the vHC. Because exposure to social defeat stress did not significantly increase neural activity in vHC neurons projecting to the BLA, a vHC-to-BLA circuit may not play a key role in controlling status-dependent changes in CD vulnerability. ","Interactions between the hippocampus and the amygdala play a critical role in processing emotional memories. While these brain regions are implicated in the development of stress-related mental illness, the role of connections between the hippocampus and amygdala in susceptibility to the effects of stress is not well understood.

Baker 207,10:00 - 10:20,10:00,Anita Marshall,Marshall,,School of Geosciences,Evaluation of a technology-based approach to inclusive/accessible geoscience field learning,"Field work in a natural setting is a highly valued component of many geoscience courses. Immersion in the natural environment is considered to be a critical part of the learning experience for geoscience students, and extended field work is often a core requirement for the completion of a geoscience degree. In addition to academic value, field work is considered a central influence on the culture of the geosciences. However, students who identify as physically disabled face numerous barriers to participation in the geosciences including environmental barriers, institutional discrimination, and social stigmas. The requirement of field work for many geoscience degrees creates even greater challenges in terms of environmental barriers and social inclusion for students with physical disabilities. The recent introduction of digital data collection and communication devices into traditional field work settings has created new opportunities to expand access to field learning experiences to students who would traditionally be excluded. One such approach is remote collaboration; a method of undertaking field work through a combination of teamwork and the use of digital communication technologies to enable students with a range of physical mobilities to engage in field learning together from different locations. For this study, academic and social engagement in a technology-enhanced field learning environment was examined through a mixed-methods study using a quantitative video analysis of engagement, a survey regarding social presence, and a detailed qualitative analysis of interview and observation data over the course of a two-year NSF-funded GEOPATHS research project. This presentation describes the results of the evaluation and outlines factors that may influence the academic and social outcomes for students undertaking field work, a topic of interest for any natural science practitioners who are interested in recruiting and retaining a more diverse student population.","Work outdoors in a natural setting is an important part of many courses in the geosciences, yet students with physical disabilities are often barred from participation by environmental and social barriers. Through the use of communication technologies and student teams, a new approach to field work allows students of all physical abilities to collaborate in real time across a field site, breaking down the physical barriers to participation. This presentation outlines the results of an evaluation of student engagement when using this new approach."

By using IUDs—devices that require a medical professional for removal—the state is able to achieve the same level of population control through reduced birth rates without the stigma associated with blatantly coercive female sterilization practices. Additionally, since IUDs can be removed by a medical professional, the procedure is entirely reversible if the woman with the IUD has access to medical care, which is not assured. Therefore, this practice of inserting IUDs without an after-care plan generate the same outcome as historically common sterilization programs. ","Intrauterine devices (IUDs) have been widely touted as emancipatory forms of birth control for women of privilege. However, the high rates of effectiveness in pregnancy prevention and low costs have made IUDs a preferred form of birth control for the state. This presentation will describe how emancipatory birth control methods for privileged women simultaneously serve as a form of soft sterilization for marginalized women. "
