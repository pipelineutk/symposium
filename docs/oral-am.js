    "Abstract": "A method to titrate enzyme activity in vivo",
    "Narrative": "The living cell is a crowded environment and there are many interactions that take place in the cell which are not considered when we study enzyme activity and kinetics in the test tube. In this study, we show that these weak but biologically relevant interactions can be harnessed to control protein activity in the cell. We have found that increasing these interactions leads to the decrease in protein activity which ultimately results in cell death."

In our research, we use computational methods to better understand the structure and properties of the catalytic, oxygen-covered silver surface in order to design optimal industrial catalytic conditions for silver that can produce increased yields of ethylene oxide over undesired side products."
