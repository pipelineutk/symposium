    "Narrative": "Conventional optical imaging technologies can detect advanced stages of bladder cancer, however they have limitations to detect bladder cancer at the early stages. The aim of this study was to evaluate the novel Cox-2 selective optical imaging agent, fluorocoxib A, for detection of early stage bladder cancer. Fluorocoxib A specifically detected Cox-2-expressing bladder cancer in contrast to normal bladder tissue where no uptake was detected."

In this exhibition, the contrary- the possibility that Europa cannot sustain human life- is explored as an unique option, giving rise  to potential new courses of action in microbial genetic engineering as a non-human alternative. In this alternative option, planetary \"microbe mining\" by terraforming foreign planetary soil is presented as recourse that benefits Earth's own ecosystem and contributes to our current understanding of the origins of life as we know it."

Encompassing the perspectives of marginalized, powerless groups could help address the greater impacts of climatic change. By recognizing the lack of social justice within current climate change policies and applying feminist theory to scientific methodology, humans can produce innovative and different behaviors to live with the earth."

Confinement in such CNT based nanofluidic devices of dimensions approaching the characteristic length scales of the fluid leads to transport phenomena that is distinct from that seen in the continuum regime. Given the lack of theories to explain nanoscale transport phenenomena, our molecular dynamic simulation studies provide a microscopic level understanding of the structural, dynamical and energetic aspects of water and ion transport through these nanoporous hydrophobic pores which is important for the rational design of CNT based applications."

    "Abstract": "Criterion Validity of Consumer and Research Grade Activity Monitors During Brief, Intermittent Walking Bouts",
    "Narrative": "Steps taken per day is a quick and easy way to assess daily physical activity levels. Physical activity trackers commonly measure rhythmic, continuous stepping (i.e., taking a walk) quite accurately, however short bouts of stepping or non-rhythmic steps (i.e., steps taken when cooking breakfast) have not shown as accurate results. These inaccuracies could be caused by filters used in devices which are employed to prevent steps from being counted when none are taken (i.e., erroneous bodily movements when seated or standing but not walking or running).  This research aims to reach a better understanding of filters by comparing device outputs during several time- and step-based intermittent walking trials."

Molecular junctions are one component of these nanoelectronics and have great potential to be applied in a wide variety of consumer products; however, there is still much unknown about the electronic properties of these systems. Our study aims to computationally investigate a variety of molecular junctions to understand the effects of different structural characteristics of the junction on its conductance properties."

Our research is examining new catalysts (Co-Schiff base catalysts) that show promise in overcoming this challenge. This presentation will describe the synthesis of a library of new Co-Schiff base catalysts and their reactivity toward lignin and lignin models."

Therefore, infants in the 2-D condition may have more fully processed the familiar stimulus, thus shifting their attention toward novel stimuli."

We found that with the acquisition of mobility, infants increasingly explored the play space, interacted with toys and furniture, and transitioned between postures as they actively explored and discovered features of the room. Mothers showed similar trends to their infants but were more likely to simply monitor their infants’ behaviors."

What is the evolutionary purpose behind not just such signs, but also this great variation seen among species? We develop a mathematical model to investigate the evolutionary trade-offs of having visual ovulation signs, and use comparative primate data to show that larger group size and higher rates of infanticide each correlates with having visual ovulation signs present, both as predicted by our model."

ASD has been shown to enhance populations of endemic fungal antagonists in soil, and we observed that ASD treatments, with or without commercial biocontrol agents, had a positive or no effect on beneficial populations of endemic Trichoderma and Bacillus. Endemic actinomycete populations were suppressed by the addition of biocontrol agents during ASD treatment."

Although the effects of both the timing of reproduction and female quality on mating systems have been studied in some species, they have been investigated primarily in isolation. Here, we demonstrate that individual quality and the timing of reproduction interact to affect reproductive success in a wild population of sex-role-reversed fish."
