    "Narrative": "Our research focuses on identifying molecular features which differ between the thermostable enzymes and their nonthermostable variants.Thermostable enzymes are able to retain their folded structure as well as their activity at high temperatures. This quality of thermostable enzymes makes them valuable for the industrial use."

    "Narrative": "Oxytocin is a neuropeptide that may be involved in autism spectrum disorder. The ability to selectively measure oxytocin secretions is challenging because neuropeptides have a similar chemical makeup. We present a new analytical separation tool with the potential to selectively probe oxytocin secretion in real-time."

    "Narrative": "Coral diseases are a major cause of coral death and black band disease is considered the most virulent. Metabolomics and flux experiments were performed on environmental coral samples collected off the coast of Cura√ßao. This data reveals higher metabolic activity during active infection and provides new insights into black band disease progression."

    "Narrative": "Copper naphthenate is a preservative used to treat millions of wooden railroad ties in the United States each year. After removal from railroads, these ties are used to fuel large industrial boilers; thus keeping them from being disposed of in landfills. Combined use of thermal desorption and 2.6-pyridine dicarboxylic acid (PDA), a biodegradable chelating agent, for extraction of this preservative from end-of-life railroad ties will allow for their use as a boiler fuel source without the release of hazardous green house gasses."

    "Narrative": "Immune system T cells are responsible for recognizing and attacking the newly transplanted tissues, resulting in organ rejection. The surface of T cells contains a protein called 2B4. Our data indicate that T cells without the 2B4 protein may have a reduced ability to become T cells that can recognize transplanted organs. These data suggest that the absence of 2B4 causes decreased cell differentiation and division, which may contribute to reduced transplant rejection"

    "Abstract": "How Are You Feeling? An Examination of an Indirect Measure of Emotional States",
    "Narrative": "While using direct self-report as a measure of emotional state is prevalent in emotion research, it functions under the assumption that people are both honest and introspective about their emotional experience; however, that is not always the case. To counter possible biases from direct self-reports, researchers developed the Implicit Positive and Negative Affect Test (IPANAT) to measure emotion indirectly. We present findings from our use of the IPANAT in our research on emotional states."
