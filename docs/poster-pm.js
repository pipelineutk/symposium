    "Narrative": "Thawing Arctic permafrost will amplify global warming because the previously stable organic carbon stores will be converted to carbon dioxide and released into the atmosphere. Current predictions of carbon released from thawing permafrost  soils are inexact. By improving our understanding of the amount of permafrost soil organic matter available for microbial decomposition we can better predict the future extent and rate of carbon dioxide production."

Computer simulations were used to determine the results of these impacts and the effects different variable metal properties have on the damage."

    "Narrative": "Recent calculations of galactic cosmic ray transport in enclosed, shielded space environments indicate that a minimum dose equivalent is achieved with a shielding thickness of ~20 g/cm^2. Increases in the dose equivalent and effective dose with shielding thickness >20 g/cm^2 are believed to be caused by the production of light ions and neutrons in the shielding. Experimental neutron yields measured in March 2016 will be incorporated in NASAâ€™s transport code uncertainty analysis which will ultimately help determine optimal shielding thicknesses for future space applications."

Through simulations of a biomass fast pyrolysis reactor, we were able to provide insight into particular run conditions that can optimize biomass conversion to biofuel without ever touching the actual reactor. This technology can help make biofuel a more competitive energy source in the global market."

    "Narrative": "Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease that results in significant tooth loss and can contribute to systemic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and cardiovascular disease. The cause of periodontal disease is unclear however we suspect it is due to an increase in abundance of certain microorganisms in the mouth, specifically anaerobic sulfate reducers. We have isolated the first Desulfobulbus sulfate reducer from the human oral cavity, Desulfobulbus oralis, and have characterized it to understand how such organisms could aid in periodontal disease progression."

    "Narrative": "Approximately 3 million cases of periodontitis are reported in the US per year. Periodontitis leads to tooth loss and secondary consequences such as inflammatory bowel disease, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Studies have shown a strong association between diseased state and a shift in the healthy oral microbiome with an increased abundance of certain bacterial species. To be able to fully understand the role of these microbes in disease progression, their cultivation and characterization is crucial."

    "Narrative": "Doxorubicin (Dox) is a widely used chemotherapeutic drug in the treatment of bladder cancer, however Dox has cardiotoxic effects. In our study we evaluated the benefits of using novel  non-cardiotoxic Dox derivatives,  AD 312 and AD 198 in bladder cancer treatment. We examined the effects of these drugs in bladder cancer cell viability and expression of key proteins that are important in cancer progression. We found that AD 312 and AD 198 is more effective than Dox  and are promising candidates for the treatment of bladder cancer."
