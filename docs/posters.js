The surface of T cells contains a protein called 2B4. Our data indicate that T cells without the 2B4 protein may have a reduced ability to become T cells that can recognize transplanted organs. These data suggest that the absence of 2B4 causes decreased cell differentiation and division, which may contribute to reduced transplant rejection"

    "Narrative": "While using direct self-report as a measure of emotional state is prevalent in emotion research, it functions under the assumption that people are both honest and introspective about their emotional experience; however, that is not always the case. To counter possible biases from direct self-reports, researchers developed the Implicit Positive and Negative Affect Test (IPANAT) to measure emotion indirectly. We present findings from our use of the IPANAT in our research on emotional states."

Increases in the dose equivalent and effective dose with shielding thickness >20 g/cm^2 are believed to be caused by the production of light ions and neutrons in the shielding. Experimental neutron yields measured in March 2016 will be incorporated in NASA’s transport code uncertainty analysis which will ultimately help determine optimal shielding thicknesses for future space applications."

The cause of periodontal disease is unclear however we suspect it is due to an increase in abundance of certain microorganisms in the mouth, specifically anaerobic sulfate reducers. We have isolated the first Desulfobulbus sulfate reducer from the human oral cavity, Desulfobulbus oralis, and have characterized it to understand how such organisms could aid in periodontal disease progression."

In our study we evaluated the benefits of using novel  non-cardiotoxic Dox derivatives,  AD 312 and AD 198 in bladder cancer treatment. We examined the effects of these drugs in bladder cancer cell viability and expression of key proteins that are important in cancer progression. We found that AD 312 and AD 198 is more effective than Dox  and are promising candidates for the treatment of bladder cancer."
