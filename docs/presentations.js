    "Narrative": "The living cell is a crowded environment and there are many interactions that take place in the cell which are not considered when we study enzyme activity and kinetics in the test tube. In this study, we show that these weak but biologically relevant interactions can be harnessed to control protein activity in the cell. We have found that increasing these interactions leads to the decrease in protein activity which ultimately results in cell death."

Physical activity trackers commonly measure rhythmic, continuous stepping (i.e., taking a walk) quite accurately, however short bouts of stepping or non-rhythmic steps (i.e., steps taken when cooking breakfast) have not shown as accurate results. These inaccuracies could be caused by filters used in devices which are employed to prevent steps from being counted when none are taken (i.e., erroneous bodily movements when seated or standing but not walking or running).  This research aims to reach a better understanding of filters by comparing device outputs during several time- and step-based intermittent walking trials."

The design and development of gradient surfaces is an efficient technique to control and optimize the extent of chemical functionality for surface modifications that is useful for tuning properties."

Our research is examining new catalysts (Co-Schiff base catalysts) that show promise in overcoming this challenge. This presentation will describe the synthesis of a library of new Co-Schiff base catalysts and their reactivity toward lignin and lignin models."

Therefore, infants in the 2-D condition may have more fully processed the familiar stimulus, thus shifting their attention toward novel stimuli."

What is the evolutionary purpose behind not just such signs, but also this great variation seen among species? We develop a mathematical model to investigate the evolutionary trade-offs of having visual ovulation signs, and use comparative primate data to show that larger group size and higher rates of infanticide each correlates with having visual ovulation signs present, both as predicted by our model."

    "Abstract": "Modeling the impact of biomass inlet conditions on its conversion to bio-oil in a fast pyrolysis reactor",
    "Narrative": "Modeling what is happening inside a reactor can reveal important details previously unknown from observation and experimentation. Through simulations of a biomass fast pyrolysis reactor, we were able to provide insight into particular run conditions that can optimize biomass conversion to biofuel without ever touching the actual reactor. This technology can help make biofuel a more competitive energy source in the global market."

    "Narrative": "Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease that results in significant tooth loss and can contribute to systemic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and cardiovascular disease. The cause of periodontal disease is unclear however we suspect it is due to an increase in abundance of certain microorganisms in the mouth, specifically anaerobic sulfate reducers. We have isolated the first Desulfobulbus sulfate reducer from the human oral cavity, Desulfobulbus oralis, and have characterized it to understand how such organisms could aid in periodontal disease progression."

    "Abstract": "Experimental design for cultivation of uncultured bacteria from the human oral cavity",
    "Narrative": "Approximately 3 million cases of periodontitis are reported in the US per year. Periodontitis leads to tooth loss and secondary consequences such as inflammatory bowel disease, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Studies have shown a strong association between diseased state and a shift in the healthy oral microbiome with an increased abundance of certain bacterial species. To be able to fully understand the role of these microbes in disease progression, their cultivation and characterization is crucial."

    "Narrative": "My research aims at developing a better understanding of the cellular and molecular responses of Caldicellulosiruptor bescii to low pH and high osmolarity as possible growth inhibitory stress conditions. We employ global omics as well as genomic screening tools developed and/or tailored for C. bescii alongside to enable identification of genetic elements involved in these stress responses and facilitate future robust strain development."

    "Narrative": "Doxorubicin (Dox) is a widely used chemotherapeutic drug in the treatment of bladder cancer, however Dox has cardiotoxic effects. In our study we evaluated the benefits of using novel  non-cardiotoxic Dox derivatives,  AD 312 and AD 198 in bladder cancer treatment. We examined the effects of these drugs in bladder cancer cell viability and expression of key proteins that are important in cancer progression. We found that AD 312 and AD 198 is more effective than Dox  and are promising candidates for the treatment of bladder cancer."

    "Narrative": "Chloroplasts must rely on the plant cell's inherent delivery system to acquire new proteins.  This phenomenon is known as protein trafficking.  Chloroplast protein trafficking requires the coordination of nanomolecular machinery as well as the recognition of a highly specific region of the chloroplast protein.  This poster explores the complexity of the FGLK region of the transit peptide involved in protein trafficking."
