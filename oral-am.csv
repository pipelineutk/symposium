213,08:30 - 08:50,Deepika Nambiar,Biochemistry & Cellular and Molecular Biology,A method to titrate enzyme activity in vivo ,"The living cell is a crowded environment and there are many interactions that take place in the cell which are not considered when we study enzyme activity and kinetics in the test tube. In this study, we show that these weak but biologically relevant interactions can be harnessed to control protein activity in the cell. We have found that increasing these interactions leads to the decrease in protein activity which ultimately results in cell death. "
