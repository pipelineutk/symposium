213,1:00 - 1:20,Jennifer Bourn,Genome Science and Technology,Detection of Cox-2-expressing early stages of bladder cancer by fluorocoxib A,"Conventional optical imaging technologies can detect advanced stages of bladder cancer, however they have limitations to detect bladder cancer at the early stages. The aim of this study was to evaluate the novel Cox-2 selective optical imaging agent, fluorocoxib A, for detection of early stage bladder cancer. Fluorocoxib A specifically detected Cox-2-expressing bladder cancer in contrast to normal bladder tissue where no uptake was detected."
213,1:25 - 1:45,Rachel Slappy,"Mechanical, Aerospace, and Biomedical Engineering",Varying Levels of Degradation in Synthetic Polymers In Vivo,"Meshes made from synthetic polymers are often used to repair hernia defects. The polymers often chemically degrade in patients causing many negative symptoms. This study found that some of these materials degrade to varying extents in patients, which is useful when selecting mesh materials. "
213,1:50 - 2:10,Victoria Ramirez-Miller,Microbiology,"""How to Deal With Rejection: Terraforming Europa by Accepting the Null Hypothesis""","Europa, a moon of the planet Jupiter, is a recently discovered celestial body theorized to have both essential environmental requirements and potential for catalytic chemical processes to create and sustain conditions habitable to human life. In this exhibition, the contrary- the possibility that Europa cannot sustain human life- is explored as an unique option, giving rise  to potential new courses of action in microbial genetic engineering as a non-human alternative. In this alternative option, planetary ""microbe mining"" by terraforming foreign planetary soil is presented as recourse that benefits Earth's own ecosystem and contributes to our current understanding of the origins of life as we know it.

How can we efficiently utilize this ever present source to our benefit to address the challenges of renewable fuels in the age of $1.50 gas?
213,3:05 - 3:30,Savannah Collins-Key,Geography,: Applying a Feminist Epistemological Approach to Climate Change,"In the efforts to combat climate change, recent studies have called for a feminist epistemological approach. Encompassing the perspectives of marginalized, powerless groups could help address the greater impacts of climatic change. By recognizing the lack of social justice within current climate change policies and applying feminist theory to scientific methodology, humans can produce innovative and different behaviors to live with the earth."
252,1:00 - 1:20,Susan Park,"Kinesiology, Recreation and Sport Studies", Sources of Error with Wearable Step Counters,"In recent years, devices such as activity monitors have become popular as more individuals are concerned about their health and measuring daily physical activity. One useful feature of activity monitors is step count however, these devices may provide inconsistent data in activities other than walking or running. In our study, we measured the accuracy of 11 activity monitors across 15 activities including: treadmill walking/running, activities of daily living and overground walking. 
"
252,1:25 - 1:45,Michelle Aranha,Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering,Transport of water and ions through single-walled armchair carbon nanotubes: A molecular dynamics study,"Carbon nanotubes (CNT) are promising materials with a vast range of potential applications, such as nanoscale electronic devices, nanoscale sensors, selective molecular filters, gas storage devices, nanofluidic devices, and targeted drug delivery devices, among many others. Confinement in such CNT based nanofluidic devices of dimensions approaching the characteristic length scales of the fluid leads to transport phenomena that is distinct from that seen in the continuum regime. Given the lack of theories to explain nanoscale transport phenenomena, our molecular dynamic simulation studies provide a microscopic level understanding of the structural, dynamical and energetic aspects of water and ion transport through these nanoporous hydrophobic pores which is important for the rational design of CNT based applications."
252,1:50 - 2:10,Ramya Enganti,Biochemistry & Cellular and Molecular Biology,Does the circadian clock regulate ribosomal protein phosphorylation? ,The circadian clock is known to regulate gene expression in plants. We are studying how the clock regulates protein synthesis through chemical modifications on specific proteins. 
252,2:15 - 2:35,Kimberly Bress,Psychology,Stress and Social Dominance: Cellular Mechanisms in the Ventral Hippocampus ,Not all individuals who experience stressful or traumatic events develop stress-related mental illness.  There is great interest in identifying the factors which make some individuals susceptible to the effects of stress and others resilient. 
252,2:40 - 3:00,Lindsay Toth,"Kinesiology, Recreation, and Sports Studies","Criterion Validity of Consumer and Research Grade Activity Monitors During Brief, Intermittent Walking Bouts","Steps taken per day is a quick and easy way to assess daily physical activity levels. Physical activity trackers commonly measure rhythmic, continuous stepping (i.e., taking a walk) quite accurately, however short bouts of stepping or non-rhythmic steps (i.e., steps taken when cooking breakfast) have not shown as accurate results. These inaccuracies could be caused by filters used in devices which are employed to prevent steps from being counted when none are taken (i.e., erroneous bodily movements when seated or standing but not walking or running).  This research aims to reach a better understanding of filters by comparing device outputs during several time- and step-based intermittent walking trials. "
252,3:05 - 3:30,Ashlyn Schwartz,Kinesiology Recreation and Sport Studies,Playground and Garden Activity Levels in Young Children,"In our lab, we analyze how outdoor environments influence play behaviors and activity levels in young children by measuring the specific elements of the environment that govern behavior.  Our ultimate goal is making play spaces conducive to physical activity by maximizing the time young children spend outdoors in natural settings."
253,1:00 - 1:20,Andrea Becker,Chemistry,Effect of Electrode Surface Structure on Electron Transport in Molecular Junctions: A Computational Study,"As nanotechnology continues to increase in complexity, circuitry has begun to approach the physical limits of Moore’s law. Molecular junctions are one component of these nanoelectronics and have great potential to be applied in a wide variety of consumer products; however, there is still much unknown about the electronic properties of these systems. Our study aims to computationally investigate a variety of molecular junctions to understand the effects of different structural characteristics of the junction on its conductance properties."
253,1:25 - 1:45,Bethany Aden,Chemistry,In situ gradient functionalization of azlactone-based block copolymer brushes,"Reactive modification of polymer thin films provides a useful route to confer new properties to the underlying material, with the range, strength and type of interaction across the interface dictated by the display of functional groups decorating the surface. The design and development of gradient surfaces is an efficient technique to control and optimize the extent of chemical functionality for surface modifications that is useful for tuning properties."
253,1:50 - 2:10,Rebecca Key,Center for Renewable Carbon,Development of Novel Nitrogenous Base-Tethered Cobalt-Schiff Base Complexes for the Selective Catalytic Cleavage of Lignin,"Lignin is the second-most abundant renewable carbon source on Earth, comprising up to 25% of biomass, thus making it an extremely attractive raw material for the production of biobased chemicals and fuels; however, its complex structure is a significant barrier to its efficient conversion to renewable materials. Our research is examining new catalysts (Co-Schiff base catalysts) that show promise in overcoming this challenge. This presentation will describe the synthesis of a library of new Co-Schiff base catalysts and their reactivity toward lignin and lignin models."
253,2:15 - 2:35,Alexandra Romano,Psychology,Effects of two- and three-dimensional visual processing on infant attention and object recognition,"The purpose of this research was to investigate the effects of controlled laboratory familiarization to an object in either two-dimensional (2-D) or three-dimensional (3-D) exposure conditions on neural event-related potential (ERP) correlates of attention and recognition memory for 6-month-old infants.  

During testing, infants in the 2-D condition were more attentive to the novel stimuli, and infants in the 3-D condition were more attentive to the familiar stimulus. Therefore, infants in the 2-D condition may have more fully processed the familiar stimulus, thus shifting their attention toward novel stimuli.

253,2:40 - 3:00,Shana Oltmann,Biochemistry & Cellular and Molecular Biology,The use of choline supplementation to mitigate the effects of stress  on the adolescent brain.,"Adolescence is a sensitive period for brain development, stress during this critical time has been shown in previous experiments (for both animals and humans) to negatively impact brain and behavioral development. Choline is an essential nutrient needed for proper brain function. Our experiment will determine if adolescent choline supplementation will reduce the negative effects of adolescent stress exposure on adult rats."
253,3:05 - 3:30,Sabrina Thurman,Psychology,Developmental changes in infant-mother spatial exploration and interaction throughout infant locomotor skill development ,"We conducted a longitudinal study to track changes in infant locomotor development in the context of infant-mother interactions. We found that with the acquisition of mobility, infants increasingly explored the play space, interacted with toys and furniture, and transitioned between postures as they actively explored and discovered features of the room. Mothers showed similar trends to their infants but were more likely to simply monitor their infants’ behaviors. "
Mary Greer,1:00 - 1:20,Erika Edwards,Animal Science,Behavior and resource use of transition dairy cows kept on pasture at calving,Our research investigates dairy cows' preferences for environment when giving birth to their calf. This will allow farmers to design their facilities around the cows' behavioral needs. 
Mary Greer,1:25 - 1:45,Farzaneh Khorsandi,Biosystems Engineering and Soil Science,Operator Safety in roll over accident,"Agriculture is one of the most dangerous industries in the US. Tractor accidents are the major cause of death in agriculture, producing about one half of the fatal accidents. Tractor overturn is the most common cause of death in tractor accidents. Three projects related to tractor operator safety in rollover accident were defined. "
Mary Greer,1:50 - 2:10,Jessie Kull,Animal Science,"Effect of acute lying and sleep deprivation on behavior, production and immune function of Holstein dairy cows","My research is looking at the effects of sleep and lying deprivation of dairy cows on behavior, immunology and production. With this project, we will start thinking about quality of rest rather than just overall quantity. "
Mary Greer,2:15 - 2:35,Kelly Rooker,Mathematics,On the evolution of visual female sexual signaling,"Why do some primate species’ females have substantial sexual swellings and/or bright colorations around their genital regions during ovulation, while other species are like humans with no visible ovulation signs? What is the evolutionary purpose behind not just such signs, but also this great variation seen among species? We develop a mathematical model to investigate the evolutionary trade-offs of having visual ovulation signs, and use comparative primate data to show that larger group size and higher rates of infanticide each correlates with having visual ovulation signs present, both as predicted by our model."
Mary Greer,2:40 - 3:00,Utsala Shrestha,Plant Science,"Assessment of soil beneficial microorganisms: Trichoderma, Actinomycetes, and Bacillus in anaerobic soil disinfestation (ASD)","Anaerobic soil disinfestation is a non-chemical crop management practice designed to control soilborne plant pathogens, weeds, and nematodes in high-value horticultural crops. ASD has been shown to enhance populations of endemic fungal antagonists in soil, and we observed that ASD treatments, with or without commercial biocontrol agents, had a positive or no effect on beneficial populations of endemic Trichoderma and Bacillus. Endemic actinomycete populations were suppressed by the addition of biocontrol agents during ASD treatment. "
Mary Greer,3:05 - 3:30,Sarah Flanagan,National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis,"Mate quality and the temporal dynamics of breeding in a sex-role-reversed pipefish, Syngnathus typhle ","The breeding patterns of species can fluctuate over time due to a number of factors, one of which is individual quality. Although the effects of both the timing of reproduction and female quality on mating systems have been studied in some species, they have been investigated primarily in isolation. Here, we demonstrate that individual quality and the timing of reproduction interact to affect reproductive success in a wild population of sex-role-reversed fish."
