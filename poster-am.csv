2,AM,Elsie Adams,Biochemistry & Cellular and Molecular Biology,Molecular Analysis of the Role of SOLO in Meiotic Sister Chromatid Cohesion,Our studies provide insight into the composition of the meiotic cohesion apparatus in Drosophila. Molecular analysis of SOLO demonstrates a possibility of it being the meiosis specific alpha kleisin subunit of Drosophila meiosis. 
2,AM,Khushboo Bafna,Genome Science and Technology,RELATING DYNAMICS AND FUNCTION IN AN ENZYME FAMILY,Understanding the underlying machinery for defense against RNA viruses.
2,AM,Amanda DeVolk,Genome Science and Technology,Biochar as a feed additive to reduce enteric methane emissions,"Raising animals, such as cows, for food production is one of the biggest human contributions to global climate change. Livestock produce methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Recent work has demonstrated that a simple, inexpensive food additive may be able to lower methane emissions from cows."
2,AM,Seda Kocaman,Biochemistry & Cellular and Molecular Biology,The role of solvent effect on the ligand-binding properties of the thermostable variants of   	 	                Aminoglycoside Nucleotidyltransferase 4' (ANT4),Our research focuses on identifying molecular features which differ between the thermostable enzymes and their nonthermostable variants.Thermostable enzymes are able to retain their folded structure as well as their activity at high temperatures. This quality of thermostable enzymes makes them valuable for the industrial use.
2,AM,Laura Casto,Chemistry,A Microfluidic diagonal electrophoresis platform for highly specific neuropeptide assays,Oxytocin is a neuropeptide that may be involved in autism spectrum disorder. The ability to selectively measure oxytocin secretions is challenging because neuropeptides have a similar chemical makeup. We present a new analytical separation tool with the potential to selectively probe oxytocin secretion in real-time.
2,AM,Sarah Creasman,Nuclear Engineering,Improved PEPT Radiotracers Comprised of 68Ga for Flow Diagnostics,"Smaller, more active radiotracers are being explored to obtain flow measurements using Positron Emission Particle Tracking. 68Ga is the basis of this work and is a good candidate due to its economic and practical advantages."
2,AM,Abigail Farmer,Chemistry,Metabolomics and flux analysis of coral infected with black band disease,Coral diseases are a major cause of coral death and black band disease is considered the most virulent. Metabolomics and flux experiments were performed on environmental coral samples collected off the coast of Cura√ßao. This data reveals higher metabolic activity during active infection and provides new insights into black band disease progression.
2,AM,Holly Haber,Biosystems Engineering and Soil Science,Optimizing Inorganic Removal from Thermally Desorbed Copper Naphthenate-Treated Railroad Ties,"Copper naphthenate is a preservative used to treat millions of wooden railroad ties in the United States each year. After removal from railroads, these ties are used to fuel large industrial boilers; thus keeping them from being disposed of in landfills. Combined use of thermal desorption and 2,6-pyridine dicarboxylic acid (PDA), a biodegradable chelating agent, for extraction of this preservative from end-of-life railroad ties will allow for their use as a boiler fuel source without the release of hazardous green house gasses.

2,AM,Michelle Halsted,Bredesen Center,Geobacter  sulfurreducens attachment and biofilm growth on electrode materials,Unveiling electrically conductive bacteria via nanotechnology. 
2,AM,Alexandra Brito,Modern Foreign Languages and Literatures,Effects of Language Immersion vs. Classroom Exposure on Advanced French Learners:  An ERP Study,"Alex Brito is a senior in the College Scholars Program at UT, studying Neuroscience, Neurolinguistics, and French. Under the mentorship of Dr. Harriet Bowden, her research project makes use of electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the effects of language immersion on second language processing."
2,AM,Phoebe Stark,Biochemistry & Cellular and Molecular Biology,2B4 DEFICIENCY IMPACTS THE EXPANSION AND PROLIFERATION BUT NOT DEATH OF DONOR-REACTIVE CD8+ T CELLS   ,"Immune system T cells are responsible for recognizing and attacking the newly transplanted tissues, resulting in organ rejection. The surface of T cells contains a protein called 2B4. Our data indicate that T cells without the 2B4 protein may have a reduced ability to become T cells that can recognize transplanted organs. These data suggest that the absence of 2B4 causes decreased cell differentiation and division, which may contribute to reduced transplant rejection"
2,AM,Rena Abdurehman,Biochemistry & Cellular and Molecular Biology,High-throughput Analysis of Protein Trafficking and Localization to the Chloroplast,"Our research focuses on better understanding the mechanism involved in protein localization to the chloroplast of immature pea plants. Our extensive study of the transit peptide sequence and TOC/TIC translocons has the potential to further the realms of bioremediation, molecular biology, agriculture, just to name a few. "
2,AM,Thao Nguyen,Biochemistry & Cellular and Molecular Biology,Analyzing Binding Affinity of Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1 Ferredoxin Mutants with Photosystem I by Chemical Crosslinking,"We are creating solar cells by enhancing the electron transfer process in photosynthesis. This is done through enhancing the binding affinity between Ferredoxin and Photosystem I of thermophilic cyanobacteria, Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1. "
2,AM,Shalini Yerukala,Entomology & Plant Pathology,Colonization of Rutgers and Mountain Spring Tomato Cultivars by the Biocontrol Agent Beauveria bassiana,"Microorganism  I'm using in my research is well established to kill insects, but can it be able to penetrate plant and help plant from outside stresses, will it have same behavioral response when treated in different plants or varieties, addressing this questions my research is focused on."
2,AM,Joyce Kuribayashi,Psychology,How Are You Feeling? An Examination of an Indirect Measure of Emotional States,"While using direct self-report as a measure of emotional state is prevalent in emotion research, it functions under the assumption that people are both honest and introspective about their emotional experience; however, that is not always the case. To counter possible biases from direct self-reports, researchers developed the Implicit Positive and Negative Affect Test (IPANAT) to measure emotion indirectly. We present findings from our use of the IPANAT in our research on emotional states. "
