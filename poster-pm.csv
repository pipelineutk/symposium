2,PM,Anna McClain,Oak Ridge National Lab - Biosciences Division,Susceptibility of Arctic Permafrost Organic Matter to Rapid Enzymatic Decomposition as a Predictor for CO2 Production,Thawing Arctic permafrost will amplify global warming because the previously stable organic carbon stores will be converted to carbon dioxide and released into the atmosphere. Current predictions of carbon released from thawing permafrost  soils are inexact. By improving our understanding of the amount of permafrost soil organic matter available for microbial decomposition we can better predict the future extent and rate of carbon dioxide production.

2,PM,Qiaoming Liu,Biosystems Engineering and Soil Science,Pretreatment approach for reducing switchgrass and loblolly pine bark inorganic impurities during gasification,This study focuses on evaluating of hot water extraction as a strategy for removing inorganics in switchgrass and pine bark.
2,PM,Natalie McGirl,Nuclear Engineering,Secondary Neutron Yields Produced by Thick-Target Aluminum Interactions,"Recent calculations of galactic cosmic ray transport in enclosed, shielded space environments indicate that a minimum dose equivalent is achieved with a shielding thickness of ~20 g/cm^2. Increases in the dose equivalent and effective dose with shielding thickness >20 g/cm^2 are believed to be caused by the production of light ions and neutrons in the shielding. Experimental neutron yields measured in March 2016 will be incorporated in NASAâ€™s transport code uncertainty analysis which will ultimately help determine optimal shielding thicknesses for future space applications.

2,PM,Kalavathy Rajan,Biosystems Engineering and Soil Science,Renewable polymers from biorefinery wastes,We are trying to develop renewable polymers from biorefinery wastes such as lignin from tree bark and hemicelluloses from pretreated wood in order to improve its sustainability. Renewable co-products also adds value to waste and generates new sources of revenue.
2,PM,Jessica Torres,Oak Ridge National Laboratory - National Transportation Research Center,Modeling the impact of biomass inlet conditions on its conversion to bio-oil in a fast pyrolysis reactor,"Modeling what is happening inside a reactor can reveal important details previously unknown from observation and experimentation. Through simulations of a biomass fast pyrolysis reactor, we were able to provide insight into particular run conditions that can optimize biomass conversion to biofuel without ever touching the actual reactor. This technology can help make biofuel a more competitive energy source in the global market."
2,PM,Karissa Cross,Microbiology,"Characterization of the first host-associated Desulfobulbus (Deltaproteobacteria) from the human oral cavity, a sulfate reducer associated with periodontal disease","Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease that results in significant tooth loss and can contribute to systemic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and cardiovascular disease. The cause of periodontal disease is unclear however we suspect it is due to an increase in abundance of certain microorganisms in the mouth, specifically anaerobic sulfate reducers. We have isolated the first Desulfobulbus sulfate reducer from the human oral cavity, Desulfobulbus oralis, and have characterized it to understand how such organisms could aid in periodontal disease progression."
2,PM,Snehal Joshi,Oak Ridge National Lab - Biosciences Division,Experimental design for cultivation of uncultured bacteria from the human oral cavity,"Approximately 3 million cases of periodontitis are reported in the US per year. Periodontitis leads to tooth loss and secondary consequences such as inflammatory bowel disease, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Studies have shown a strong association between diseased state and a shift in the healthy oral microbiome with an increased abundance of certain bacterial species. To be able to fully understand the role of these microbes in disease progression, their cultivation and characterization is crucial.  "
