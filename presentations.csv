An Examination of an Indirect Measure of Emotional States,"While using direct self-report as a measure of emotional state is prevalent in emotion research, it functions under the assumption that people are both honest and introspective about their emotional experience; however, that is not always the case. To counter possible biases from direct self-reports, researchers developed the Implicit Positive and Negative Affect Test (IPANAT) to measure emotion indirectly. We present findings from our use of the IPANAT in our research on emotional states. "
